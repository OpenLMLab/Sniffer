{"text": "High salt has been linked to the development of autoimmune diseases. In this study, we investigated the effect of high salt on inflammatory mediator production by ARPE-19 cells and explored possible underlying mechanisms. ARPE-19 cells were cultured with LPS in DMEM supplemented with 20 mm or 40 mm salt. Salt at 40 mm greatly increased IL-6 and MCP-1 production, while IL-8 levels remained unchanged. High mannitol, as an osmotic stress control, did not affect the secretion of inflammatory mediators. Coculture of ARPE-19 cells with salt resulted in significant increases in the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, AKT, and NF-B, as well as in the upregulation of NFAT5 and SGK1. These findings suggest that high salt may enhance the production of inflammatory mediators in ARPE-19 cells by activating the aforementioned signaling pathways.", "label": "alpaca"}

Six hundred and forty-two semen samples from sub-fertile men were analyzed. Ninety-two men (15%) reported tobacco chewing. These subjects were grouped according to their intensity of chewing (10 packets/day, n=64, or 6.3% of all subjects) vs. non-tobacco chewing group (n=27, or 2.2% of all subjects).\n\n Significant decrements in sperm counts (2.2 fold, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.5-3.09), motility (3.2 fold, 95% CI 2.05-4.9) and normal morphology (8.4 fold, 95% CI 4.9-14.6) were observed in tobacco-using men compared to non-tobacco users. Compared to mild tobacco users, intensive users had a significant effect on sperm morphology only (2.7 fold, 95%CI 1.41-5.08) and structural defects in head (p<0.001) and cytoplasmic residues (p<0.001) were found to be positively correlated with intensive chewing. No significant changes were found in anomalies in mid-piece and tail. \n\nIn conclusion, tobacco chewing had a negative impact on semen parameters and morphology, with the severity of the defects correlated with the intensity of the habit.", "label": "alpaca"}

{"text": "Historically, the U.S. Census has had a difficult time accurately counting the Hispanic population due to the changes in question wording over the years. The 1970 Census was the first to include a specific Hispanic origin question, however it still had some flaws as people incorrectly identified as “American” instead of Mexican, Puerto Rican, or Cuban. By 1980, the question was moved to the short form, which eliminated the inclusion of individuals of Spanish/Hispanic origin in the “Central or South American” category. This change resulted in an estimated 14.6 million Hispanics, which was a considerable jump from the 9.1 million count of 1970.

The victim's family was outraged and police had failed in protecting them. According to a Facebook statement released by his sister, Victoria Jabara Williams, Mr Jabara had called police on Friday \"stating this man had a gun and that he was scared for what might happen.\" Police responded and left the neighbourhood without questioning Majors, and Mr Jabara was killed just eight minutes later while talking on the phone outside. \n\nThe incident comes after an imam and his associate were shot and killed while walking from their mosque in Queens, New York. Majors was taken into custody and is expected to be formally charged with first-degree murder and possession of a firearm after a felony conviction. The Jabara family said Majors had harassed them since 2013, when Haifa Jabara was granted a protective order against him. He was arrested and charged with violating the restraining order against him on 18 March, 2015, but released from jail after posting bond.

Companies will be reliant on European mainland storage capacities for their gas supply during this time, Marzec-Manser noted, implying that they will have to pay a premium for this service. It appears that technical issues have been ongoing at Rough since March 2015, when Centrica placed restrictions on storage levels due to well issues.

{"text": "In recent years, reports have emerged of adrenal dysfunction occurring in a wide range of liver diseases. Adrenal insufficiency (AI), which is characterized by decreased levels of circulating cortisol, has been shown to be associated with the progression of liver disease. To gain further insight into this phenomenon, this study evaluated AI in subjects with acute liver disease (ALD), chronic liver disease (CLD) and post liver transplantation (LT).\n\n                Clinical, biochemical and adrenal function assessments were conducted on 25 healthy controls, 25 ALD patients, 20 CLD patients with Child-Pugh stage A (CLD-1) and 30 CLD patients with Child-Pugh stage B/C (CLD-2). Nineteen percent of ALD patients, 34.6% of CLD-1 patients and 60% of CLD-2 patients were found to have AI. The overall prevalence of AI increased as the severity of liver disease worsened, as evidenced by higher rates of AI in CLD-2 compared to CLD-1 (18 vs. 4, respectively). AI was also more common in LT recipients compared to non-LT recipients (4 vs. 0, respectively).\n\n                Significant differences in basal, stimulated and incremental cortisol levels were observed between patients with liver disease and healthy controls. AI was associated with lower levels of serum protein, serum albumin, total cholesterol and HDL cholesterol, and higher levels of serum bilirubin and INR.\n\n                In conclusion, this study reveals that adrenal dysfunction is a common occurrence in patients with liver disease, particularly in those with more severe disease severity. This should be taken into consideration in the management of these patients, as AI can severely affect their prognosis.", "label": "alpaca"}

{"text": "This paper introduces a new model for second-order non-stationary random functions - a convolution of an orthogonal random measure with a spatially varying random weighting function. This new model is a generalization of the common convolution model, where a non-random weighting function is used. The resulting class of non-stationary covariance functions is very general, flexible, and allows to retrieve classes of closed-form non-stationary covariance functions known from the literature, for a suitable choices of the random weighting functions family. Under the framework of a single realization and local stationarity, we develop a parameter inference procedure of these explicit classes of non-stationary covariance functions. From a local variogram, a weighted local least-squares approach in combination with a kernel smoothing method is developed to estimate the parameters. Results on two real datasets - soil and rainfall data - show that the proposed approach outperforms the stationary one, according to several criteria. Furthermore, conditional simulations can be carried out in this non-stationary framework.  Non-stationarity, convolution, covariance, kernel, kriging and simulation.", "label": "alpaca"}

{"text": "This study evaluated the change in conversion degree ( DC ) in the 12 hours following initial photoactivation of a low-shrinkage composite resin ( Venus Diamond). Attenuated Total Reflection (ATR) spectra were acquired from the bottom surface of each sample immediately after the initial photoactivation (P=0), 30 minutes (P=0.5) and 12 hours after photoactivation (P=12) in order to obtain the DC progression during the post-curing period. Interactions between thickness (T), irradiation time (I) and post-curing (P) on the DC were calculated through Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) testing. All the first-order interactions were statistically significant, with the exception of the T-P interaction. The shift from P=0 to P=12 had a statistically higher influence than the shift from P=0.5 to P=12. The post-curing period played a fundamental role in achieving higher DC values with the low-shrinkage nano-hybrid composite resin tested in this study. Additionally, both T and I strongly influenced the DC. Therefore, increased irradiation time may be useful in obtaining a high DC with a low-shrinkage nano-hybrid composite resin, particularly with 2 mm composite layers.", "label": "alpaca"}

In small-scale applications, such as wellhead and point-of-entry water treatment systems, the need to maintain a stock solution of concentrated H2O2 increases the operational cost and complicates the AOP. To avoid this, a gas diffusion electrode was used to generate low concentrations of H2O2 directly in the water prior to its exposure to UV light. Following the AOP, the solution was passed through an anodic chamber to lower the solution pH and remove the residual H2O2. \n                        \nThe effectiveness of the technology was evaluated using a suite of trace contaminants that spanned a range of reactivity with UV light and hydroxyl radical (HO) in three different types of source waters (i.e., simulated groundwater, simulated surface water, and municipal wastewater effluent) as well as a sodium chloride solution. \n                        \nThe energy consumption for each order (EEO) ranged from 1 to 3 kWh/m3, with the UV lamp accounting for most of the energy consumption.

{"text": "After more than two decades of experimentation with avant-garde cinematic techniques, Luis Buñuel's surrealist masterpiece Un Homme et une Femme (1964) is a landmark of modern cinema. Despite a few vivid surrealist set pieces, however, the movie ultimately fails to live up to its full potential. The underlying theme of religious repression and guilt is explored in a haphazard way that seems contrived rather than meaningful. The pacing is agonizingly slow, and the main character’s violent behavior is never fully addressed or analyzed. Too many of the surrealist moments seem included simply for the shock value that was the director’s trademark, rather than to further explore the ideas of the film. Still, Un Homme et une Femme is a valuable piece of cinema history and will likely remain an important work in the surrealist film movement.", "label": "alpaca"}

Their debut record Psychotropic was a hit, delivering a perfect mix of surf and garage rock that was well-received by fans. What Happened, the band's latest offering, takes a decidedly drier and fuzzier approach, championing a sinister blend of rhythm and blues and modern garage rock. Battery Acid proves to be an exhilarating opening track, slowly building in intensity with a chorus of drums and guitars that propel the song forward. Running of Time and Wasted are other notable tracks, featuring powerful rhythms and hypnotic riffs, while The Door provides a welcome respite with its softer, more melodic sound. Title-track What Happened is a somber ballad that slowly builds in intensity, before reaching a climatic, emotional peak.

{"text": "17th April 2012 – 5.04 pm \nOnce upon a time, I had no idea the capabilities of my directional scanner. When venturing out in high-sec empire space, I had little need for it. But eventually, my corporation made the first steps into w-space, and I started to use it defensively, set to full range and angle, showing me all that was out there that could be seen. I used it to give me warning of when to run away. \n\nAt some point, I read a guide showing how d-scan could be used to locate ships in space with surprising accuracy. This astounded me. But to be honest, it should have scared the crap out of me. The local channel is not populated in w-space, so you have no idea who's in the system with you. And if you only need one scan to find any ship in the system, the pilot can truly sneak up on other pilots without warning.  Sitting in a site or empty space, a skilled pilot can find you. \n\nNow I’m a hunter and really appreciate what d-scan can do for me, so it’s all cool. I wish I could remember where I first saw that guide to using d-scan. Not only can I give credit to the capsuleer who showed me how to realize the power of d-scan, but I can also link to the guide directly and not have to write my own. \n\nFor this exercise, I shall use a friendly Retriever, with the hopes that the mining barge will make my killer instinct kick in. And it is an exercise, not a live hunt. I don’t want to lose a target because I’m too busy trying to take a bunch of illustrative screen grabs, and if I do lose the target, then the series of images will be left unfinished.  Even though it is an exercise, however, no steps will be fudged. \n\nI need to park the Retriever in empty space so that I am forced to use d-scan to find it, so I create a safe spot that looks suitably impossible to find by chance. \n\nOf course, I can’t keep the bookmark to the safe spot, otherwise the hunt would be reduced to pointing d-scan at and arranging probes around the bookmark, so I delete it. Let’s hope I can find our ship again. \n\nTime to pretend! \n\nI’ve jumped in to a w-space system and punched d-scan. Oh look, there’s a Retriever in the system, but I bet it’s sitting safely inside the shields of the tower that’s also visible.  \n\nI locate the tower and—what’s this?—the Retriever is still on d-scan but not at the tower. The hunt is on! \n\nNow to glance over the initial few steps that hopefully are already known.

{"text": "Nearly every decision in the latest wave of MLS soccer-specific stadiums comes with a premium on creating environments boasting intimacy. Not the touchy-feely, quiet type of intimacy, but the loud, raucous style that puts tens of thousands of fans as close to one another and as on top of the pitch as possible. Orlando City Stadium gives us a real-time example of the trend, even as we're about to see soccer-specific designs opening next year for Minnesota United, D.C. United and Los Angeles Football Club that mimic the effort. As MLS buildings grow in size, now expanding past the typical 18,000-seat designs of the past toward capacities of 25,000, the larger sizes come with a focus on creating an intense environment, says Bruce Miller, lead soccer architect for Populous, designers of the new venues in Orlando, St. Paul, Minnesota, and Washington, D.C. \"MLS is expanding right now while other sports are creating different seating types and shrinking capacity,\" Miller tells FourFourTwo. \"Twenty-five thousand will drive demand and create a great atmosphere. It is really giving our owners pause in terms of what the capacity should be and what they should be planning for in the future.\" Top 20 stadiums FourFourTwo's 20 best stadiums for soccer in the U.S. And as 25,000 sits as a tipping point — buildings larger than 25,000 really require a second concourse to best serve the population with amenities — it has also creates amenity-rich designs that differ from MLS venues of yesteryear. No longer is bare-bones construction, such as the first soccer-specific venues we saw in 1999 into the mid-2000s, the order of the day. MLS owners can now afford more. The most architecturally pleasing and atmosphere-creating element of what we're seeing in current soccer-specific design, and what we will continue to see moving forward, is the canopy, a feature rarely added to the cost of early MLS projects. It's not just a roof that shields the weather from the fans. A canopy gives venues a European-style design that also serves to reflect crowd noise back toward the pitch. To coincide, Miller says there are more seats between aisles in soccer venues — less in-game vendors allows this — and a tight continuous bowl around the pitch serves to \"intensify the experience.\" Troy Taormina-USA TODAY Sports Jonathan Emmett, design principal for Gensler Sports, architects of the upcoming Banc of California Stadium for LAFC, echoes the \"intense, yet intimate\" words. \"The first generation of U.S. venues lacked these qualities, which tend to be trademarks of traditional British and European venues,\" he says. \"Steep rakes of seating, tight field and sideline dimensions, roof canopies are signature elements of the LAFC stadium and these attributes will become the benchmark within MLS.\" In Orlando, for example, the crowd presses to just 15 feet from the pitch. Paired with a tight bowl design, soccer venues have moved communal areas to the corner terraces, allowing for the bowls to close and amplify the atmosphere. As you can see, a simple canopy can make dramatic changes. Stadiums can be designed to look and sound like you're actually at a soccer game.", "label": "alpaca"}

Patients diagnosed for diabetes for shorter duration of time (4-7 years) showed bleeding index-disease severity correlation of 1.760. Further studies are necessary to better understand the causative relationships between periodontal and metabolic state in type 1 diabetes mellitus.", "label": "alpaca"}

{"text": "Killer T cells are a subset of T cells that destroy cells which have been infected with viruses or are otherwise damaged or dysfunctional. They achieve this task by recognizing specific antigens upon binding to them via the T cell receptor (TCR). This is aided by a co-receptor, CD8, and the binding of this antigen-TCR complex to the MHC I receptors of the target cell. When activated, killer T cells release cytotoxins like perforin which form pores in the target cell's plasma membrane, allowing ions, water and toxins to enter. Granulysin, another toxin, triggers the apoptosis of the target cell. T cell activation is tightly controlled and usually requires a strong MHC/antigen signal, or additional signals from helper T cells.", "label": "alpaca"}
{"text": "Previous classification studies of Q2122-444, an optical galaxy, had suggested it to be a naked or true Type 2 AGN, one without a Broad Line Region (BLR). Further inspection of its spectrum revealed only narrow forbidden emission lines typical of such Type 2 AGN, but the long-term optical light curve, taken from a monitoring campaign of over two decades, showed strong variability, implying no significant obscuration. Here, we present the results of an XMM-Newton observation of Q2122-444, aimed at shedding light on the energetics of this intriguing AGN. The X-ray analysis was complemented with Atca radio data to assess the possible presence of a jet, and new NTT/Esfoc2 optical spectroscopic data to verify the actual lack of a BLR. The higher-quality optical data revealed the presence of strong and broad Balmer lines at odds with the original classification. Additionally, the lack of detection of radio emission rules out the presence of a jet. Combined with the ultraviolet observations from the OM aboard Hubble, Q2122-444 is revealed to be a typical Type-1 AGN without any significant intrinsic absorption. New estimates of the black hole mass, independently obtained from the broad Balmer lines and from a scaling technique based on the X-ray spectral data, suggest it is accreting at a relatively high rate in Eddington units.", "label": "alpaca"}

{"text": "When insects communicate using sound or use acoustic cues to evade predators or detect prey or hosts, they must localize the sound in most cases in order to perform adaptive behavioral responses.  In the case of particle velocity receivers such as the antennae of mosquitoes, directionality is not a problem because such receivers are inherently directional.  Insects equipped with bilateral pairs of tympanate ears could make use of binaural cues for sound localization, similar to all other animals with two ears.  Nevertheless, their small size presents a major obstacle when aiming to create sufficiently large binaural cues, both in terms of interaural time differences ( ITDs) and interaural intensity differences ( IIDs).  In my review, I will only briefly cover these biophysical aspects of directional hearing. Instead, I will focus on aspects of directional hearing that received relatively little attention previously, such as evolution of a pressure difference receiver, 3D hearing, directional hearing outdoors, and directional hearing for auditory scene analysis.", "label": "alpaca"}

Ray Milland, Mischa Auer, Charles Winninger and John King also appear, with Binnie Barnes and Alice Brady rounding out the supporting cast. The story follows three young women, now living in Switzerland with their divorced mother, who hear their father is marrying again. Not recognizing him in 10 years and fully aware their mother still loves him, the trio set sail for America, with the help of the housekeeper/nanny, determined to stop the wedding. Realizing the intended is only a gold-digger aided and abetted by her mother, the girls arrange for the woman to be introduced to a wealthy Count, with the father's accountant playing matchmaker. Of course, the man he selects is a full-time drunk, with the young women believing him to be a real wealthy Count. The laughter and shenanigans that ensue provide plenty of entertainment in this delightful film with some fine performances from Auer, Milland, Barnes and Brady. Young Durbin is beautifully trained vocally and a natural actress, effortlessly carrying the film. Her vocal prowess is highlighted in a stunning performance of \"\"Il Bacio\"\" in a police station.\n\n                        The emphasis of the movie is very much on the young girls, showing the father to not really want his children around until he sees them and discovers the youth he was seeking in his daughters. Barnes definitely plays the part of the glamorous, older woman, while the age gap between her and the men in the film provides a nice contrast. Universal gives this film a star-building spotlight for Durbin, who at this point was still paying her dues in the business. Nevertheless, her presence and charm make her a standout in the film and certainly provide the spark that keeps audiences invested. All in all, Three Smart Girls is a charming and entertaining film, sure to bring a smile to faces of all ages.", "label": "alpaca"}

Fortunately for the indiscretions of my youth and senility of my advancing age, there may be worse movies I've seen, but thankfully, I can't remember them.

The HCECs were then exposed to test solutions including 0.5% timolol maleate, 1% trusopt, 0.5% timoptol, preservative-free 1% dorzolamide, travatan, travatan Z, xalatan, and benzalkonium chloride (BAK) for 10, 30, and 60 minutes, or 48 hours. Cell viability was measured using a WST-1 assay. Toxicity of each solution was compared to the controls using a Cell Viability Score (CVS).\n                    Results:\n                        After 48 hours of exposure, HCEC viabilities were 48.5% for 0.5% timoptol, 80.9% for preservative-free 0.5% timolol maleate, 47.0% for 1% trusopt, 71.7% for preservative-free 1% dorzolamide, 55.5% for travatan, 88.5% for travatan Z, and 52.5% for xalatan. Exposure to test solutions diluted 100-fold or more resulted in HCEC viabilities > 80%. The order of cell viability was travatan Z, preservative-free timolol maleate = preservative-free dorzolamide > 0.5% timoptol = 1% trusopt > travatan > xalatan. Assessment of the combined effect of drug and BAK revealed that latanoprost reduced the toxicity of BAK.\n                    Conclusion:\n                        Antiglaucoma eye drops produced HCEC toxicity that appeared to depend on the presence of BAK.

The current monarch, Queen Elizabeth II, is the longest-reigning British monarch in history, having ascended the throne in 1952. She is also the longest-serving British monarch, having now served for over 67 years. \n\n                                                                                                                         \n                                                                                                                \n            The monarch's powers have been largely ceremonial since the 17th century, though the Queen retains a number of formal and ceremonial roles, such as the appointment of ministers and the summoning of parliament. Her powers of course include the ability to veto certain bills and give Royal Assent to other bills. The Queen is also Head of the Commonwealth and Chancellor of the University of London. \n\n                                                                                                                \nThe British monarchy has evolved and changed over the years, but the current Queen has been its longest-serving and longest-reigning monarch in history.", "label": "alpaca"}
{"text": "We compared middle-aged and elderly adults with normal blood pressure ( normotensive ) and those with high blood pressure ( hypertensive ) with and without type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ). We found that those with hypertension had significantly lower integrity of white matter microstructures as seen on MRI-based diffusion tensor imaging compared to the normotensive participants. Additionally, the hypertensive participants with T2DM had more widespread white matter pathology than those without T2DM. Furthermore, both hypertension and T2DM were associated with decreased retinal arterial diameter, with the effect of hypertension being more pronounced in the presence of T2DM. The hypertensive participants with T2DM also had significantly worse retinal arteriolar diameters compared to their normotensive counterparts. These findings suggest that the damaging effects of hypertension are exacerbated by T2DM and that the frontal lobe may be particularly vulnerable to such microvascular damage.", "label": "alpaca"}

Inflammatory Cytokines (TNF-, IL-6, IL-10 and TGF-), Lipokines (Leptin, Adiponectin), Reactive High-Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hs-CRP) and In Vitro Inflammatory Lympho-Monocyte Responses to Microbial Stimulus were evaluated. Leptin and hs-CRP were correlated with BMI, whereas Adiponectin was significantly reduced in all PCOS groups. Although Cytokines were similar in all groups, Interleukin-6 (IL-6) was significantly higher in IR PCOS. Moreover, in the latter group, lipopolysaccharide-activated monocytes secreted significantly higher levels of IL-6 compared to NIR and Control subjects.

{"text": "In her address to the British Science Festival, Dame Athene Donald emphasizes the importance of mathematics and science education for the general public. She argues that requiring students to specialize in these subjects too soon results in divisive behavior, with citizens being “forced to make good decisions in their private lives - be it about vaccinations, mobile phone masts, or climate change.” To tackle this issue, she advocates for a change in the UK education system, urging for more young people to receive an education in these subjects. \n\n                    In addition, Dame Athene addresses gender inequality, asserting that while “science is so integral in our everyday lives, having an attitude that it’s all nasty, scary, and dangerous stuff is enormously unhelpful if not positively dangerous.” She stresses the importance of empowering parents, teachers, and students to have a better understanding of these subjects and make judgments with confidence. To achieve these goals, she suggests targeting education at a younger age, ensuring it is more inclusive and accessible for both genders, and making sure those teaching the subjects receive the proper training in order to spread an understanding of science in society. \n\n                ### Output: \n                    Britain needs to shift its culture to appreciate that science and math can and should be accessible to all, new British Science Association president Dame Athene Donald has said. In her address to the British Science Festival, the university physicist argued that requiring children to specialize too soon in their studies divides the nation “into sheep and goats, science people and arts people.”\n\n                    Donald recommended that society need to become more inclusive of these subjects, with parents, teachers and students needing to be more mindful of their attitudes. She advocated for a less gender-based approach to the sciences, asserting that “science is so integral in our everyday lives, having an attitude that it’s all nasty, scary, and dangerous stuff is enormously unhelpful if not positively dangerous.” Therefore, she proposed targeting education at a younger age to ensure that both genders are given equal footing and are not intimidated by these subjects.\n\n                    In addition, Dame Athene addressed the need to provide appropriate training to those teaching the sciences. She stressed that “we should be working hard to ensure that parents are not bamboozled by basic facts”. To tackle any potential gender gap in these areas, she highlighted the significance of providing equal opportunities for both genders. “We need to change mindsets of teachers and parents alike to ensure that both genders get equal airtime in the classroom,” she added. \n\n                    In conclusion, Britain needs to embrace the importance of math and science education, from primary schools all the way to post-16. This should be seen as a tool to create a wiser and more informed public, asserting that “too often we find ourselves apparently in opposing camps - and our culture these days always makes it seem as if the scientists are the outsiders.” Therefore, British society should make an effort to promote scientific knowledge, provide access to all, and give people enough tools to make informed decisions about science, technology, and the environment.", "label": "alpaca"}

{"text": "We calculate the contribution to the cosmic X-ray background (CXB) from a population of power law spectrum sources with broadly distributed spectral indices. The composite spectrum from this source population is significantly harder than predicted by a single power law with average spectral indices. Starting from spectral distributions similar to those observed from quasars, we can reproduce the CXB from 23.5 cm to 24 cm with a good accuracy. If the spectra of quasars steepen at around 100 keV, the resulting composite spectrum perfectly fits the CXB in the even broader energy range up to 24 cm. The QSO population with broadly distributed spectral parameters is also characterized by a significant discrepancy between the results of hard and soft X-ray source counts. Similarly to the comparison of HEAO-1/GINGA and EINSTEIN/ROSAT measurements, allowing the spectra of QSOs to span a broad range of spectral indices enables us to reproduce both the CXB spectrum and account for the apparent differences in number counts in different energy bands.", "label": "alpaca"}

{"text": "The role of chiropractic in US health care has yet to be established, and third-party payors and public policy makers must make decisions about the appropriateness of chiropractic care and the services it provides. Studies evaluating the appropriateness of chiropractic care may inform these decisions. The purpose of this article is to discuss the implications and limitations of appropriateness studies for chiropractic.\n \nWe reviewed the general context for assessment of the appropriateness of chiropractic care and the application of appropriateness studies to chiropractic in particular. We evaluated the implications and limitations of the Rand–UCLA appropriateness method, which has been applied to the evaluation of spinal manipulation. Regional variations in chiropractic utilization have yet to be described through small area analysis, but these methods appear to hold some potential for assessing the appropriateness of chiropractic care. Both small area analysis and the Rand–UCLA method offer limited possibilities for the assessment of chiropractic appropriateness. \n\nFuture assessment of the appropriate role for chiropractic in US health care will require considerations beyond what has been studied previously.

{"text": "In 1929, director Walt Disney and animator Ub Iwerks changed the face of animation with the release of the very first installment of their \"\"Silly Symphonies\"\" series, \"\"The Skeleton Dance\"\". Iwerks and Disney had been collaborating together since the early 20s, in Disney's \"\"Laugh-O-Gram\"\" cartoon series; however, their friendship suffered a tremendous blow when Iwerks accepted an offer by a competitor to leave Disney and start his own animation studio. That was the birth of Celebrity Productions, where Iwerks continued developing his style and technique (and where he created the character of Flip the Frog). While his work kept the same high quality, it wasn't really popular and by 1936 the studio was closed. Later that year, Iwerks was hired by Columbia Pictures, and Iwerks decided to return to his old skeletons for another dance, this time in color. \n\n1937's \"\"Skeleton Frolics\"\" is essentially, a remake of the 1929 classic \"\"The Skeleton Dance\"\", the movie that borough him fame and fortune. Like that short film, it is set on an abandoned graveyard, where at midnight the creatures of the night come alive and begin to play a happy tune. The dead rise from their coffins, ready for the show that's about to begin, as a group of skeletons has formed an orchestra, and begin to play a happy tune. Now, it's not easy to be a musician made of just bones, as some of the orchestra members have problems with their body parts, however, the band manages to put a good show and another group of skeletons begin to dance. A lovely couple of them faces the same problems that troubled the orchestra: it's hard to dance with loose body parts. Everything ends at dawn, and just when the sun is about to rise again, the skeletons run towards their graves. \n\nDirected and animated by Ub Iwerks himself, \"\"Skeleton Frolics\"\" follows faithfully the pattern set by \"\"The Skeleton Dance\"\" years before, although with a crucial difference: Iwerks did the whole film in Technicolor. The bright tonalities allowed Iwerks to create a more visually appealing film, and also to use the many new techniques he had been practicing since leaving Disney, creating even better effects of depth and dynamism than those he conceived before. It is certainly a more experimental film than \"\"The Skeleton Dance\"\", although sadly, this doesn't mean it's necessarily a better film. For starters, the film is practically identical to the one he did with Disney, with the only differences being the music (more on that later) and the color effects. It looks beautiful, no doubt about it, but it definitely feels kind of unoriginal after all. \n\nHowever, it is not the unoriginality of the concept what truly hurts the film (after all, Iwerks executes it in a wonderful way), but the fact that the musical melody created by Joe DeNat for the film is pretty uninteresting and lacks the charming elegance and whimsical fun of the one done by Carl W. Stalling for \"\"The Skeleton Dance\"\". In other words, while DeNat's tune is effective and appropriate for the theme, it's easy to forget about it rapidly while Stalling's song has a unique personality that makes it unforgettable. Being a musical film, this is of high importance, and so the mediocrity of the music brings down Iwerk's flawless work of animation. Personally, I think that with a better musical accompaniment, \"\"Skeleton Frolics\"\" would be remembered as fondly as \"\"The Skeleton Dance despite not being as groundbreaking, as it's still a fun film to watch.", "label": "alpaca"}

This enables us to perform the complete spin foam quantization of the model and compare it with the various proposals for the implementation of the simplicity constraints after quantization.

{"text": "There is increasing evidence that the same brain reward circuits involved in fuelling addictive behaviour, such as drug abuse, are implicated in the hedonic cravings and overeating observed clinically in overweight and obese people. A variation in the dopamine receptor D2, which makes it less responsive to dopamine, has been proposed to promote self-stimulatory activities, such as substance abuse, gambling and food binging. It is important to determine how this genetic variation might interact with other known genetic markers for obesity, such as the Leptin receptor and Opiomelanocortin gene variations linked to upper-body fat.  Leptin, a proinflammatory cytokine as well as a long-term signal maintaining body fat, can stimulate systemic inflammation throughout the body, including the brain. The association of numerous diseases, such as diabetes, heart disease and depression, with chronic low-grade inflammation caused by abdominal obesity, suggests that this inflammation may be responsible for addictive behaviours which can lead to a self-perpetuating cycle involving both food and addictions. This new area of research holds the promise of developing innovative treatments for both drug abuse and obesity.", "label": "alpaca"}
{"text": "In solar EUV spectra, the He I and He II resonance lines show unusual behavior and have anomalously high intensities compared to other transition region lines.  To investigate this, extensive non-LTE radiative transfer calculations are conducted using the model atmospheres of Vernazza, Avrett & Loeser (1981). These model atmospheres provide reasonable matches to the He II line intensities, but significantly overestimate the intensities of other transition region lines. \n\nNew model atmospheres from Macpherson & Jordan (1999) are derived from emission measure distributions derived from observations of transition region lines. These models fail to reproduce the observed He II line intensities by significant factors. Furthermore, power law suprathermal tails of the electron distribution function may form via the transport of fast electrons from high temperature regions and give rise to increased collisional excitation rates in the He lines.\n\nCollisional excitation and ionization rates are recomputed for the power law tails and it is found that such distributions can give rise to enhanced He II line intensities. However, many of the predictions of the models regarding line ratios are inconsistent with observations.

{"text": "In 1936, the world was presented with a stark warning of what could happen if mankind continued down its current path. The message of the movie \"\"Things to Come\"\" focused its lens on England, but it could just as easily represent any nation of the world. When war finally does arrive, it's ravages continue not for another five years, but until 1966 at which time Everytown is completely destroyed. Adding to the desolation and toll on humanity is the \"wandering sickness\", a pestilence that continues for another four years. \n\n                  The movie paints a futuristic yet fatalistic world view, where science offers a glimpse of hope for a revived civilization. The \"Wings Over the World\" concept plays out a bit corny, though Cabal (Raymond Massey) is unwavering in his mission and dedicated to his cause. If he fails, others will follow. This message is continually reinforced throughout the movie. \n\n                  Man's insatiable need to test the limits of knowledge and achievement requires an \"all the universe or nothing\" mindset.

It tried to cram too much into one story, that of a young lawyer and his journey to becoming a junior partner at his law firm. The plot was cliché and the drama was lacklustre, at best. The dialogue was painful to hear and there was not much comedy. Only the acting of the four main players was adequate. Set during the Great Depression, it was a reaffirmation of good ol' home spun American values of family, relationships, heroism, perseverance, and initiative. The movie was released in early 1939, soon after the USA began to get production going for the coming World War II. As a piece of disguised socio-political propaganda, it was a great booster for the general public.

During the court martial, which is set to begin on 21 September, prosecutors must prove that he knew the information he was giving to al-Qaeda could be seen by them. If the prosecution fails to demonstrate that he had this intention, the charge must be dismissed. To demonstrate this, government prosecutors argued that Pte Manning's actions must be judged in the context of the times - stating that while he may not have known the specific consequences of his actions, he did know the leaked material could be seen by al-Qaeda. Defence lawyer David Coombs argued that the reports leaked by Pte Manning would demonstrate he had little or no knowledge of the likely consequences of his actions. During pre-trial hearings, presiding judge Col Denise Lind heard arguments about whether or not the leaked material actually harmed US interests - and whether this mattered. Defence lawyer David Coombs said he believed the reports would show the leaks did little harm.

{"text": "During adaptive angiogenesis, a key process in the etiology and treatment of cancer and obesity, the vasculature changes in response to the metabolic needs of its target tissues. Although the precise cues governing vascular remodeling are not fully understood, it is believed that target-derived signals play a crucial role.  Here, we identify an alternative mechanism by characterizing the previously unrecognized nutrient-dependent plasticity of the Drosophila tracheal system: a network of oxygen-delivering tubules that is akin to mammalian blood vessels. We find that this plasticity, particularly prominent in the intestine, drives organ-specific responses to metabolic change. Mechanistically, it is regulated by distinct populations of nutrient- and oxygen-responsive neurons that, through delivery of both local and systemic insulin- and vip-like neuropeptides, sculpt the growth of specific tracheal subsets. Thus, we describe a novel mechanism by which nutritional cues modulate neuronal activity to give rise to organ-specific, long-lasting changes in vascular architecture.", "label": "alpaca"}

{"text": "I want very much to believe that the above quote, which was actually written, not spoken, in a rejection letter a publisher sends to the protagonist, was meant to be self-referential in a tongue-in-cheek manner. But if so, director Leos Carax apparently neglected to inform the actors of the true nature of the film. They are all so dreadfully earnest in their portrayals that I have to conclude Carax actually takes himself seriously here, or else has so much disdain for everyone, especially the viewing audience, that he can't be bothered letting anyone in on the joke. \n\n                Some auteurs are able to get away with making oblique, bizarre films because they do so with élan and unique personal style (e.g., David Lynch and Alejandro Jodorowsky). Others use a subtler approach while still weaving surreal elements into the fabric of the story (e.g., Krzysztof Kieslowski, and David Cronenberg's later, less bizarre works). In Pola X, Carax throws a disjointed mess at the viewer and then dares him to find fault with it. Well, here it is: the pacing is erratic and choppy, in particular continuity is often dispensed with; superfluous characters abound (e.g., the Gypsy mother and child); most of the performances are overwrought; the lighting is often poor, particularly in the oft-discussed sex scene; unconnected scenes are thrust into the film for no discernible reason; and the list goes on.\n\n                Not to be completely negative, it should be noted that there were some uplifting exceptions. I liked the musical score, even the cacophonous industrial-techno music being played in the sprawling, abandoned complex to which the main characters retreat in the second half of the film (perhaps a reference to Andy Warhol's 'Factory' of the '60s?). Much of the photography of the countryside was beautiful, an obvious attempt at contrast with the grimy city settings. And, even well into middle-age, Cathering Deneuve shows that she still has 'it'. Her performance was also the only one among the major characters that didn't sink into bathos. \n\n                There was an earlier time when I would regard such films as \"\"Pola X\"\" more charitably. Experimentation is admirable, even when the experiment doesn't work. But Carax tries nothing new here; the film is a pastiche of elements borrowed from countless earlier films, and after several decades of movie-viewing and literally thousands of films later, I simply no longer have the patience for this kind of unoriginal, poorly crafted tripe.

This and other observations led up to the developments of vaccination and Louis Pasteur's proposed germ theory of disease. Pasteur's work eventually overturned contemporary theories of disease, such as the miasma theory, and it was not until Robert Koch's 1891 proofs that microorganisms were confirmed as the cause of infectious disease.

{"text": "We consider two-dimensional beams whose transverse size may be comparable to or smaller than the carrier wavelength. To describe them, we extend the full nonlinear Schrödinger equation derived from the Maxwell's equations. This equation is quite complicated, so we also study its simplified version which keeps the most essential term — the term that accounts for the nonlinear diffraction.  The full equation also includes terms generated by a deviation from the paraxial approximation and by a longitudinal electric field component in the beam. \n\n                     Solitary wave stationary solutions to both the full and simplified equations are found, treating the terms that modify the nonlinear Schrödinger equation as perturbations.  Within the framework of the perturbative approach, a conserved power of the beam is obtained in an explicit form.  It is found that the nonlinear diffraction affects stationary beams much stronger than nonparaxiality and longitudinal field. \n\n                     Stability of the beams is directly tested by simulating the simplified equation, with initial configurations taken as predicted by the perturbation theory.

{"text": "During his illustrious career as a cricketer, Clive Rice made a lasting impression on the game. Between the years of 1969 and 1986, Rice had the privilege of representing South Africa in both first-class and limited overs cricket. As a right-handed batsman, he was known for being particularly adept with thewillow, employing a powerful and muscular technique that made him a potent force against any bowling attack. As a bowler, his speed and control with the ball was feared by many, and he was particularly revered as a death-overs specialist. Rice was also a renowned captain, leading both his domestic team, Transvaal, and South Africa in limited overs cricket. Off the field, Rice was no less remarkable. During the days of Kerry Packer's WSC, Rice was an integral part of the South African side which toured Australia and England.

He was the driving force behind a successful Transvaal side, and his mentorship of young players such as Shaun Pollock, Lance Klusener and Jonty Rhodes is something that the world of cricket owes much gratitude for. Sadly, Rice's career came to an abrupt end in 1986 when he was discarded from both South Africa and Transvaal due to political and administrative changes within the country.

{"text": "We utilize the nonequilibrium Green's function formalism to investigate time-dependent thermal transport in a linear chain system connecting two semi-infinite leads, driven by an external agent which can absorb and emit energy. Numerical solutions to the Dyson equation for the contour-ordered Green's function reveal the energy current flowing from the leads, which depends on the values of the driving frequency and temperature. When the leads have the same temperature, our results show that modulating the coupling between the leads may direct energy to either flow into the leads simultaneously or flow out of them simultaneously, depending on the frequencies and temperatures. A special combination of values existing wherein no net energy flows into or out of the leads even after long times. When one of the leads is warmer than the other, net energy flows out of the warmer lead while for the cooler one, the direction of the energy current flow depends on the values of the driving frequency and temperature.

Coinbase (#26) and 21 Inc (#48) also made the list, while blockchain startup Colu, made an entry for the companies to watch out for in 2016. Colu isn't the only Bitcoin-related company in the list, as Coinify and Elliptic are also other companies listed. Despite the impressive performance of Chinese companies this year, no Bitcoin or blockchain company from China has made it to the Fintech 100 list yet. Yet, with China reaching an all-time high performance in trading of Bitcoin, it is only a matter of time until a Bitcoin or blockchain company from China makes it to the list.", "label": "alpaca"}
{"text": "UKIP reported donations of £1.4 million from April to June this year, surpassing the amount reported by the Liberal Democrats. A UKIP spokesman said it was \"a sign that electorally and financially we are now superceding the Liberal Democrats\". The Conservatives reported £7.2 million of donations for the second quarter of the year, while Labour reported £3.8 million. This period coincided with the UK's European elections, in which UKIP was the clear winner and is now aiming to get its first MPs elected at the next general election. More than a million pounds of UKIP's donations came from a single donor, the Yorkshire businessman Paul Sykes, showing the massive financial support he has provided the party. The Lib Dems said this demonstrated that UKIP is a \"one-man party - \"one man politically and one man financially\". Their own donations totaled £1.2 million, with more donors than ever before contributing. However, the Lib Dems pointed out that the figures should have included £241,000 of UKIP's donations from the previous quarter, which would put them not behind but level with UKIP. Overall, the figures illustrate the intensifying battle between the three major parties for cash ahead of the 2021 general election. The Conservatives noted that Labour has received £34 million from trade unions since Ed Miliband became leader in 2010. The party said this demonstrated \"the payback they want from weak Ed Miliband: more wasteful spending, more taxes, and more debt than our children could ever hope to repay\".", "label": "alpaca"}

{"text": "This study aimed to investigate the differing effects of fixing the thoracolumbar junction versus just the pelvis in relation to abdominal drawing-in maneuver (ADIM) on trunk extension activities. 40 healthy adults took part, with trunk extension activities being measured using surface electromyography. The results showed that, when fixing the pelvis and the thoracolumbar junction together, thoracic extensor activity was increased significantly compared to either pelvic fixation alone or pelvic fixation with ADIM. On the other hand, lumbar extensor activity was reduced significantly when ADIM was applied together with thoracolumbar fixation. Therefore, this study suggests that fixing the thoracolumbar junction together with ADIM is an effective method of increasing thoracic extensor activity and decreasing lumbar extensor activity compared to fixation of the pelvis alone.", "label": "alpaca"}

This process is regulated by cdk downregulation, which is not sufficient to guide mitotic exit alone.

We are beginning to gain a more detailed understanding of its regulation during anaphase and its role in organizing the successful progression of mitosis.

{"text": "The definition of the fundamental quantity, the chemical potential, is inconsistent in the literature, with three distinct definitions being found in various books and papers. While these definitions give the same result in the thermodynamic limit, major differences can occur for finite systems, even for systems as large as a quantum dot. To resolve this, we argue that the chemical potential, conventionally represented by the symbol @xmath1, should be the uniquely correct definition valid for all finite systems, in the grand canonical ensemble. This defines the ensemble most appropriate for statistical thermodynamics, whenever the chemical potential is physically relevant. The zero temperature limit of this definition, derived by Perdew et al. for electrons, is further extended and considered for semiconductors.

{"text": "While the concept of a \"social market economy\" was only introduced into EU law in 2007, the free movement and trade of goods, services, labour and capital were central to European development since the Treaty of Rome 1957. The standard theory of comparative advantage states that two countries can benefit from trade even if one of them has a less productive economy in all respects. \n\n                Like in other regional organizations such as the North American Free Trade Association, or the World Trade Organization, breaking down barriers to trade and enhancing free movement of goods, services, labour and capital was meant to reduce consumer prices, while protecting people's well being. It was originally theorized that a free trade area had a tendency to give way to a customs union, which would eventually lead to a common market, monetary union, and eventually a full union characteristic of a federal state. \n\n                In Europe, however, those stages were considerably mixed, and it remains unclear whether the \"endgame\" should be the same as a state, traditionally understood. In practice free trade, without standards to ensure fair trade, has been beneficial to some people and groups within countries (e.g. large businesses) but at the expense of people who lack bargaining power in an ever-expanding market, such as workers, consumers, small businesses, developing industries, and communities. \n\n                The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union articles 28 to 37 establish the principle of free movement of goods in the EU, while articles 45 to 66 require free movement of persons, services and capital. These so-called “four freedoms” were intended to be inhibited by physical barriers (e.g. customs), technical barriers (e.g. differing laws on safety, consumer or environmental standards), and fiscal barriers (e.g. different Value Added Tax rates). \n\n                The tension in the law is that the free movement and trade is not supposed to encroach upon unrestricted commercial profit, and the Treaties limit free trade to prioritize other values such as public health, consumer protection, labour rights, fair competition, and environmental improvement. Increasingly the Court of Justice has taken the view that the specific goals of free trade are underpinned by the general aims of the treaty for a better quality of life for people in the EU.", "label": "alpaca"}

{"text": "After losing its former importance as a colonial power and in the field of tropical medicine, Germany began to search for a new place in international health care during decolonization. University development aid, which began in 1956, provided medical academics from West German universities with opportunities to become involved in several Asian, African, and South American countries. The example selected for closer study is the support for the Togolese National Hygiene Institute, a former German colony and now a prolific ally of the West. Through this collaboration, multiple arrangements were made between public health and scientific research, between development aid and academia, and between West German and West African interests. These arrangements had important impacts on this cooperation. For example, having qualified national staff became a decisive factor for the project in a country like Togo, where higher education had been neglected under colonial rule. In addition, while routine services soon worked well, research required more sustained capacity building and did not lead to joint work on equal terms.

(ii) For the Photos Monte Carlo, which generates radiative corrections in arbitrary decays, new results on next-to-leading order corrections became available for some decay modes. The complete corrections were installed for leptonic τ-lepton decays into a pair of scalars. (iii) During the workshop, the importance of checking the uncertainty of the overall normalization for Korabl and KKMC simulations was underlined. Necessary steps to check the uncertainty and to adjust the programs to Belle and BaBar conditions were also listed.", "label": "alpaca"}
{"text": "GERDA employs germanium detectors both as a source and a detector, enriched to yield an abundance of around 8%. The detector crystals are then encased in a vessel full of argon, lined by copper and surrounded by a large tank of highly purified water, all of which reduces background radiation to an extraordinary degree. Utilizing these techniques, GERDA achieved background levels that are a billion times lower than double beta decay rates. \n             \nGermanium detectors wrapped by a high-purity copper foil for radiation shielding. \n                The observation of the incredibly rare phenomenon requires precise methods to reduce background radiation from the surroundings and experiment itself. The researchers overcame this challenge by encasing the crystals in a vessel filled with argon, lined by ultrapure copper and further shielded by a 10-meter-diameter tank filled with purified water, all situated over 1400 meters below ground. Finally, this detector system was able to reduce the radioactive noise to an unprecedented level.", "label": "alpaca"}

{"text": "The \"freedom to provide services\" under the European Union's Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) Article 56 applies to individuals who provide services \"for remuneration\", especially commercial or professional activities. For example, in Van Binsbergen v Bestuur van de Bedrijfvereniging voor de Metaalnijverheid a Dutch lawyer moved to Belgium while advising a client in a social security case, and was told he could not continue because Dutch law stated that only people established in the Netherlands could give legal advice. The Court of Justice held that the freedom to provide services applied, it was directly effective, and the rule was likely unjustified: having an address in the member state would be enough to pursue the legitimate aim of good administration of justice. The Court of Justice has held that secondary education falls outside the scope of Article 56, because usually the state funds it, though higher education does not. Health care generally counts as a service. In Geraets-Smits v Stichting Ziekenfonds Mrs. Geraets-Smits claimed she should be reimbursed by Dutch social insurance for costs of receiving treatment in Germany. The Dutch health authorities regarded the treatment unnecessary, so she argued this restricted the freedom (of the German health clinic) to provide services. Several governments submitted that hospital services should not be regarded as economic, and should not fall within Article 56. But the Court of Justice held health was a “service” even though the government (rather than the service recipient) paid for the service. National authorities could be justified in refusing to reimburse patients for medical services abroad if the health care received at home was without undue delay, and it followed “international medical science” on which treatments counted as normal and necessary. The Court requires that the individual circumstances of a patient justify waiting lists, and this is also true in the context of the UK’s National Health Service. Aside from public services, another sensitive field of services are those classified as illegal. Josemans v Burgemeester van Maastricht held that the Netherlands’ regulation of cannabis consumption, including the prohibitions by some municipalities on tourists (but not Dutch nationals) going to coffee shops, fell outside Article 56 altogether. The Court of Justice reasoned that narcotic drugs were controlled in all member states, and so this differed from other cases where prostitution or other quasi-legal activity was subject to restriction. If an activity does fall within Article 56, a restriction can be justified under Article 52 or overriding requirements developed by the Court of Justice. In Alpine Investments BV v Minister van Financiën a business that sold commodities futures (with Merrill Lynch and another banking firms) attempted to challenge a Dutch law that prohibiting cold calling customers. The Court of Justice held the Dutch prohibition pursued a legitimate aim to prevent “undesirable developments in securities trading” including protecting the consumer from aggressive sales tactics, thus maintaining confidence in the Dutch markets. In Omega Spielhallen GmbH v Bonn a “laserdrome” business was banned by the Bonn council. It bought fake laser gun services from a UK firm called Pulsar Ltd, but residents had protested against “playing at killing” entertainment. The Court of Justice held that the German constitutional value of human dignity, which underpinned the ban, did count as a justified restriction on freedom to provide services. In Liga Portuguesa de Futebol v Santa Casa da Misericórdia de Lisboa the Court of Justice also held that the state monopoly on gambling, and a penalty for a Gibraltar firm that had sold internet gambling services, was justified to prevent fraud and gambling where people’s views were highly divergent. The ban was proportionate as this was a suitable and necessary way to tackle the serious problems of fraud that arise over the internet.", "label": "alpaca"}

Though people may feel a deep discomfort regarding the fundamental wrongness of the act of eating animal products, the social pressure from those around them often causes people to conform and give into the majority opinion, even when it does not align with their personal beliefs. Thus, even as vegetarians or vegans who are privately certain of their beliefs, we may still find ourselves doubting and questioning our own perceptions in the face of social pressure.", "label": "alpaca"}
{"text": "Although both olive oil- and fish oil-based lipid emulsions have been demonstrated to have anti-inflammatory effects, the immunomodulating properties of lipids remain controversial. To explore the anti-inflammatory potential of these lipid emulsions further, we administered three different parenterally-administered lipid emulsions to inflamed murine cremaster muscle via intravital microscopy and systemic lps-induced systemic inflammation models. We found that olive oil-based clinoleic and fish oil-based smoflipid significantly suppressed leukocyte adhesion compared to the soybean oil-based lipid emulsion, lipofundin. In the lethal endotoxemia model, however, lipofundin was the only lipid emulsion that augmented leukocyte adhesion. Further experiments using flow chamber and adhesion molecule expression analysis suggested that both endothelial and leukocyte-driven mechanisms might contribute to the anti-inflammatory effects of clinoleic. In conclusion, these results indicate that clinoleic is superior to smoflipid and lipofundin in attenuating murine inflammation, suggesting that it could be a promising therapeutic strategy for critically ill patients with systemic inflammation.", "label": "alpaca"}

We model the state of the component appropriately and incorporate a realistic cost structure for corrective maintenance, as well as condition-based maintenance (CBM). In particular, we show that the optimal long-run average cost policy for the model at hand is a control-limit policy, where the control limit depends on the time until the next scheduled opportunity. Furthermore, we explicitly calculate the long-run average cost for any given control-limit time-dependent policy and compare various policies numerically.", "label": "alpaca"}
{"text": "Courts have distinguished between two types of civil disobedience: “Indirect civil disobedience involves violating a law which is not, itself, the object of protest, whereas direct civil disobedience involves protesting the existence of a particular law by breaking that law.” During the Vietnam War, courts typically refused to excuse the perpetrators of illegal protests from punishment on the basis of their challenging the legality of the Vietnam War; the courts ruled it was a political question. The necessity defense has sometimes been used as a shadow defense by civil disobedients to deny guilt without denouncing their politically motivated acts, and to present their political beliefs in the courtroom. However, court cases such as U.S. v. Schoon have greatly curtailed the availability of the political necessity defense. Likewise, when Carter Wentworth was charged for his role in the Clamshell Alliance's 1977 illegal occupation of the Seabrook Station Nuclear Power Plant, the judge instructed the jury to disregard his competing harms defense, and he was found guilty. Fully Informed Jury Association activists have sometimes handed out educational leaflets inside courthouses despite admonitions not to; according to FIJA, many of them have escaped prosecution because “prosecutors have reasoned (correctly) that if they arrest fully informed jury leafleters, the leaflets will have to be given to the leafleter’s own jury as evidence.”", "label": "alpaca"}

{"text": "Recent experiments have utilized scanning tunneling microscopy to investigate the effects of Kondo impurities in quantum corrals assembled on Cu or noble metal surfaces. The solution of the two-dimensional version of the one-particle Schrödinger equation in a hard-wall corral without impurity is useful to predict the conditions under which the Kondo effect can be projected to a remote location (the quantum mirage). To model a soft circular corral, we solved this equation under the potential given by xmath0, where xmath1 is the distance to the center of the corral and xmath2 its radius. We expand the Green's function of electron surface states given by xmath3 for xmath4 as a discrete sum of contributions from single poles at energies xmath5. The imaginary part xmath6 is the half-width of the resonance produced by the soft confining potential, and turns out to be a simple increasing function of xmath7.\n\nIn presence of an impurity, we solved the Anderson model at arbitrary temperatures using the resulting expression for xmath3 and perturbation theory up to second order in the Coulomb repulsion xmath8. We calculated the resulting change in the differential conductance xmath9 as a function of voltage and space, in circular and elliptical corrals, for different conditions, including those corresponding to recent experiments. The main features are reproduced. The role of the direct hybridization between impurity and bulk, the confinement potential, the size of the corral and temperature on the intensity of the mirage are analyzed.

{"text": "While the Treaty and Regulations have direct legal effect if clear, unconditional, and immediate, Directives do not generally give citizens standing to sue other citizens. This is because the TFEU article 288 states that Directives are addressed to the member states and typically \"leave to the national authorities the choice of form and methods\" for implementation. Such provisions typically establish minimum requirements that member states have to fulfill, thus allowing them to enact higher standards. For example, the Working Time Directive mandates that each worker has a right to at least 4 weeks paid vacation per year, while most member states go beyond such requirements by granting them more than 28 days of vacation leave. Despite this, on the current position adopted by the Court of Justice, citizens do not have the right to make claims based on Directives only, but are instead able to do so through national law.\nThis contentious view was first proposed by Three Advocate Generals in the early 1990s and argued that Directives should give rights and duties to all citizens. The Court of Justice rejected this, but there are, however, five notable exceptions. The five exceptions are the Working Time Directive, the Health and Safety at Work Directive, the Pregnant Workers Directive, the Parental Leave Directive, and the Equal Pay Directive. These exceptions demonstrate that the Directive may still provide protection to citizens even if it does not have horizontal direct effect. In conclusion, Directives can have a major influence on setting minimum standards for worker’s rights, safety, and equality, though they do not always grant citizens standing to pursue claims against other citizens.", "label": "alpaca"}
{"text": "The generator coordinate (GC) method is a variational approach to the quantum many-body problem, in which interacting many-body wave functions are constructed as superpositions of generally non-orthogonal eigenstates of auxiliary Hamiltonians containing a deformation parameter. This paper presents a time-dependent extension of the GC method as a new approach to improve existing approximations of the exchange-correlation (XC) potential in time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT).\n\nThe time-dependent GC method is shown to be a conceptually and computationally simple tool to build memory effects into any existing adiabatic XC potential. As an illustration, the method is applied to driven parametric oscillations of two interacting electrons in a harmonic potential (Hooke’s atom). It is demonstrated that a proper choice of time-dependent GCs in conjunction with the adiabatic local-density approximation reproduces the exact linear and nonlinear two-electron dynamics quite accurately, including features associated with double excitations that cannot be captured by TDDFT in the adiabatic approximation.", "label": "alpaca"}

In comparison, probabilistic tests rely on a partly random approach, where the same result is only guaranteed with a certain chance of success (p).

However, this strategy has been limited due to the low cell survival and/or development of dyskinesia.

Afterwards, either hB-NSC aggregates in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or PBS only were injected into the ipsilateral striatum. Behavioral tests, multitracer (2-[18F]-fluoro-D-glucose (18F-FDG) and [18F]-n-(3-fluoropropyl)-2-carbomethoxy-3-(4-iodophenyl)nortropane (18F-FP-CIT) microPET scans, as well as immunohistochemical (IHC) and immunofluorescent (IF) staining were conducted to evaluate the results.\n\n                ### Results: The stepping test showed significant improvement of contralateral forelimb control in the hB-NSC group from 6-10 weeks post-transplantation (p<0.05).

{"text": "Evidence suggests that normal trichromacy might be better suited for picking fruit at arms' reach compared to other visual search tasks. This could be due to the human colour vision system optimizing itself for spotting fruit from a distance. As such, normal trichromats have a larger advantage over both colour deficient trichromats and dichromats in finding fruit pieces from a larger viewing distance than from a close range. This discrepancy in efficiency between tasks might be due to the fact that the task where normal trichromacy is best at is not necessarily the same one where the largest evolutionary advantage occurs. We tested this in a naturalistic visual search task by examining the performance of normal trichromats, dichromats, and anomalous trichromats in finding fruit pieces at various viewing distances. Our results suggest that the optimum viewing distance for normal trichromats is at around 12 meters, where they have the largest performance advantage over both colour deficient trichromats, and dichromats.

That same year, the couple hired an engineer and gravel and stone were brought in to improve the structural integrity of Amy Hart Path, the road they planned to subdivide the land with. After approval from the town, drainage pipes were installed and metal rods were placed along the path to mark the boundaries. With the approval of the town, the couple secured utility poles and installed utilities on all four lots. Christian Leblanc also cleared an acre, installed a driveway and burned brush before the lawsuit was filed, halting all construction.In 1995, Karen Carroll successfully sued to have Amy Hart Path declared a public road, allowing the Carrolls to bring utilities to the properties. The state's adverse possession law was upheld as the court ruled that the couple had gone through with the necessary steps to successfully complete the process. The ruling traces the history of adverse possession law in Rhode Island, which was first enacted in 1896.

This spectrum shows a complex mix of emission and absorption features in both the soft and Fe K band, indicating the presence of multiple components. We detect emission and absorption lines in the energy range between 0.55 keV and 5.0 keV, associated with ionized Fe XVII and XVIII transitions. In addition, we observe an emission line at the energy of 6.4 keV, consistent with the Fe K edge. Our best-fit model requires at least three different components: (i) a hot emission component likely associated with the hot interstellar medium in this elliptical galaxy with a temperature of 0.4 keV; (ii) a warm absorber with an ionization parameter of logNe∮ed (erg s cm)−1 = 7.2 and a column density of logNe∮ed (cm) = 20.8, respectively; (iii) a lowly-ionized reflection component in the Fe K band likely associated with the optical broad line region or the outer accretion disk.

{"text": "The aim of the study was to review our experience with single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SLS) and compare costs and operative time to standard laparoscopic surgery (SLS). A prospectively collected database of operative times and costs was analysed for the years 2008-2011. SLS cases were compared to SLS on a procedure-matched basis. Patient demographics, on-table time and consumable costs were collated. Descriptive statistics and the Mann-Whitney U-test were utilized with SPSS for Windows. \n\n                  Analysis of the data showed that neither consumable costs nor operative time were significantly different in each group. Comparing operative costs, SLS appendicectomy, nephrectomy / heminephrectomy and ovarian cystectomy / oophorectomy showed cost benefit over SLS (397 vs. 467, 942 vs. 1127, 394 vs. 495). A trend toward higher cost for SLS palomo procedure is noted (734 vs. 400). Operative time for SLS appendicectomy, nephrectomy / heminephrectomy, and palomo was lower compared to SLS (60 vs. 103 mins., 130 vs. 60 mins., 60 vs. 80 mins.). \n\n                  In conclusion, SLS appears to be cost-effective for the common pediatric surgical operations.

{"text": "In this study, we aimed to investigate the potential protective effects of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced hepatotoxicity in Hep3B human hepatoma cells. We focused on some proinflammatory markers and oxidative damage as possible mechanisms of LPS- associated cytotoxicity, and the Hep3B human hepatoma cells were chosen as a model for investigation of LPS toxicity and the effect of EGCG on LPS-exposed cells. \n\nMaterials and methods: The Hep3B human hepatoma cells were used for this study. The cytotoxic effects of chemicals (LPS, EGCG) and ast/alt levels, sod/cat activities, gsh-px levels, and tnf-alpha/il-6 levels were detected by different biochemical and molecular methods. LPS and EGCG were applied to cells at various times and doses.\n\nResults: The highest treatment dose of EGCG (400 m) led to a dramatic decrease in sod level and increase in cat and gsh levels. Additionally, the highest dose of EGCG also led to a dramatic increase in tnf-alpha and il-6 levels. On the other hand, effective doses of EGCG (200, 100 m) normalized all related parameters levels.\n\nConclusion: LPS caused hepatotoxicity, but interestingly, a high dose of EGCG was found to be a cytotoxic agent in this study. However, other two doses of EGCG led to a decrease in both inflammatory cytokine levels and antioxidant enzyme levels. Further studies should examine the effect of EGCG on secondary cellular signaling pathways.", "label": "alpaca"}

Although this is an increase from the current rate of $10.55, activists and unions have been pushing for a higher wage of $14 per hour.The Premier stated that the 75-cent increase is a “fair adjustment” that reflects the rise in the Consumer Price Index (CPI). The CPI is a measure of the average change in prices over time that consumers pay for a basket of goods. Opponents of the increase argue that it is too big a jump for businesses to absorb all at once, and the Ontario Convenience Stores Association suggests that some store owners may be affected by the new minimum wage.The Retail Council of Canada agrees, noting that using the CPI to determine the catch-up raise for the past four years is “unnecessary, tough for small business, and counter-productive.”For those working in the sector, the new plan to tie future increases to the rate of inflation is welcomed.Dave Bryans, CEO of the Canadian Restaurant and Foodservices Association, commented that this will provide more stability for their sector, but warns that the 75-cent increase will result in fewer jobs. \nAmelia White, a single mother who works at a grocery store for minimum wage, states, “it's not enough to look after my child and it's not enough to live on.” She has to find additional work to make ends meet and fears that this will only increase her workload.White stresses that the minimum wage should be higher to provide a living wage, and that this will help with other issues like poverty and inequality.", "label": "alpaca"}
{"text": "We study the stability of standing shock waves in advection-dominated accretion flows into a Schwarzschild black hole by 2D general relativistic hydrodynamic simulations as well as linear analysis in the equatorial plane. We demonstrate that the accretion shock is stable against axisymmetric perturbations but becomes unstable to non-axisymmetric perturbations. The results of dynamic simulations show good agreement with linear analysis on the stability, oscillation and growing time scales. The comparison of different wave-travel times with the growth time scales of the instability suggests that the instability is likely to be of the Papaloizou-Pringle type, induced by the repeated propagations of acoustic waves. However, the wavelengths of perturbations are too long to clearly define the reflection point. By analyzing the non-linear phase in the dynamical simulations, it is shown that quadratic mode couplings precede the non-linear saturation. It is also found that not only short-term random fluctuations by turbulent motions but also quasi-periodic oscillations take place on longer time scales in the non-linear phase. We give some possible implications of the instability for quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) and the central engine for gamma-ray bursts (GRBs).", "label": "alpaca"}

{"text": "The Tor signaling pathway is essential for the translation of nutrient inputs into protein synthesis in animals, allowing for growth. We recently identified the bud32 (yeast)/prpk (human) ortholog in Drosophila, prpk (p53-related protein kinase), and found that it is required for Tor kinase activity. bud32/prpk is an ancient and atypical kinase conserved in evolution from Archaea to humans, and has been linked with p53 stabilization in human cell culture. It has been associated with t6a (threonylcarbamoyladenosine) synthesis, a special chemical modification that occurs at position 37 of trnas, which pair a-starting codons and is necessary for proper translation in most species. The core constituents of the KeOPS complex are present in Drosophila, but their physical interaction has not been reported yet. Here, we review the findings regarding the function of this complex in different organisms and note that depletion of kae1 or prpk, in accordance with their role in translation in yeast, is able to induce the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) in Drosophila.

{"text": "Subsampling and block-based bootstrap methods have been widely used in inference problems involving time series data, to account for dependence between data points. These resampling methods involve a bandwidth parameter, such as subsampling window width and block size in the block-based bootstrap. In empirical work, using different bandwidths can lead to different inference results, yet traditional first-order asymptotic theory does not account for the choice of the bandwidth. To address this issue, we propose to adopt the fixed-parameter approach, as advocated by Kiefer and Vogelsang (2005) in the heteroscedasticity-autocorrelation robust testing context. Under the fixed-parameter asymptotic framework, we derive the asymptotic null distribution of the p-values for subsampling and the moving block bootstrap, and further propose calibrated confidence intervals and tests. Our treatment is fairly general as it includes both finite-dimensional parameters and infinite-dimensional parameters, such as marginal distribution function and normalized spectral distribution function. Simulation results show that the fixed-parameter approach is more accurate than the traditional small-parameter approach in terms of approximating the finite sample distribution, and that the calibrated confidence sets tend to have smaller coverage errors than the uncalibrated counterparts.\n\n15. \n      \n# Test for equal proportions in two independent samples\ndef test_equal_proportions(k, n1_, n2_):\n    \"\"\"\n    Test whether two independent samples have the same proportion.\n\n    Parameters\n    -----------\n    k : int\n        Number of observations in each sample.\n    n1 : int\n        Number of observations in the first sample.\n    n2 : int\n        Number of observations in the second sample.\n\n    Returns\n    -------\n    boolean\n        True if equal proportions were found, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    import warnings\n    warnings.warn(\"This function is deprecated and will be removed in a future version. \"\n        \"Use scikit-stats.test_pwc instead.\")\n    from skstats.test_pwc import test_pwc\n    result = test_pwc(k, n1, n2)\n    return result", "label": "alpaca"}

Furthermore, we present a formal algebraic presentation of the concept of group computation structure, which is based on the standard definitions of a free group and conjugacy. Subsequently, we relate the geometric and algebraic views on computation by using the fundamental theorem of combinatorial group theory.

The M1 Garand can load 1.5 times more ammunition and has a significantly higher fire rate compared to the Springfield. \n\n               2.

Being a true horror fan, I was thrilled to find that it not only exceeded my expectations, but also ranks among the great parody/comedy films of late. \n                 My only concern is that its comedic elements may not be fully appreciated by mainstream audiences. This is due to the film's not-so-subtle application of multiple horror genre clichés, which had me chuckling with delight at every turn. \n                 There was also theexpected gore, ranging from the expected stabs and slashes to the customised garden shears.

{"text": "We have imaged 12 white dwarf debris disk candidates from the WIRED SDSS DR7 catalog, aiming to confirm or rule out disks among these sources. On the basis of positional identification and flux density spectra, we find that seven white dwarfs exhibit excess infrared emission, mostly at the WISE W1 and W2 bands. Four are due to nearby red objects consistent with background galaxies or very low mass dwarfs, and one exhibits excess emission at 8.0 μm consistent with an unresolved L0 companion at the correct distance. Photometry is not inconsistent with all seven excesses arising from disks, but the stellar properties of these sources are distinct from the known population of debris disk white dwarfs, making the possibility questionable. Further investigation of these sources is needed, and warm Spitzer imaging may be helpful to resolve galaxies from the white dwarfs and provide more accurate flux measurements.", "label": "alpaca"}
{"text": "Fourth, according to the Court of Justice, national courts have a duty to interpret domestic law \"as far as possible in the light of the wording and purpose of the directive\". Textbooks often refer to this as the \"indirect effect\" of a directive. In Marleasing SA v La Comercial SA, the Court of Justice held that a Spanish court had to interpret its general Civil Code provisions on contracts lacking cause or defrauding creditors to conform with the First Company Law Directive article 11, which required incorporations would only be nullified for a fixed list of reasons. The Court of Justice swiftly acknowledged that the duty of interpretation cannot contradict clear language in a domestic statute. However, fifth, if a member state has failed to implement a directive, individuals may have the right to bring legal action against non-state parties, but cannot sue the member state itself for failure to implement the law. In Francovich v Italy, the Italian government had failed to set up an insurance fund for employees to claim unpaid wages if their employers had gone insolvent, as the Insolvency Protection Directive required. Francovich, the former employee of a bankrupt Venetian firm, was thus allowed to claim 6 million Lira from the Italian government in damages for his loss. The Court of Justice held that if a directive conferred identifiable rights on individuals, and there was a causal link between a member state’s violation of EU law and a claimant’s loss, damages must be paid. Even if the incompatible law was an Act of Parliament, this was not considered a valid defence.", "label": "alpaca"}

Our Sun has recently been through regions of the galaxy with significant interstellar matter, which can have a significant impact on the structure of the heliosphere. To gain a better understanding of these changing conditions, observations of nearby stars in the direction of the Sun's recent trajectory were taken at the highest resolutions available, including the Tull spectrograph on the Harlan J.

However, a complex array of absorbers was seen in stars beyond 120 pc, indicating the presence of smaller-scale structure in the interstellar medium. Common interstellar absorbers were found in most sight lines, although significant spatial variation was also detected between closely-spaced sight lines, emphasizing the complexity of the morphology and physical properties of the gas in the ISM.

{"text": "DirecTV Group (DTV) has a big decision to make on NFL Sunday Ticket, its popular programming package. About 2 million of the satellite TV broadcaster's subscribers, 10% of its customers, pay to get NFL Sunday Ticket. If DirecTV wants to renew its exclusive deal to broadcast National Football League games on Sundays, it'll have to pay more than the $1 billion it now pays each year, analysts say. The satellite TV broadcaster's $4 billion, four-year deal lapses after the 2014 season. But while Walt Disney's (DIS) ESPN in 2011 agreed to pay 73% more for its rights to NFL Monday Night Football, about $1.9 billion a year, DirecTV has signaled it's not willing to hike its costs by that much. On DirecTV's Q1 earnings call on May 7, DirecTV CEO Mike White called NFL Sunday Ticket a \"pretty mature product\". The football package, though, has been a big promotional tool for DirecTV in the summer and fall. DirecTV has offered NFL Ticket free to new subscribers for one season. About 2 million die-hard fans pay $199 a year for the football package, on top of their regular subscription fee. Some of them, perhaps a sizable number, might cancel DirecTV altogether if the satellite-TV firm takes a pass on the NFL deal. Most analysts expect DirecTV to renew the NFL deal — if the price is right. \"I think the max they pay is a 25% to 30% increase,\" said Jeffrey Wlodarczak, an analyst at Pivotal Research Group. Macquarie Capital analyst Amy Yong, in a research report, said she expects DirecTV to pay \"20% to 25%\" more under a new multiyear deal. The $4 billion deal DirecTV struck to carry games through the 2011-2014 seasons marked a 43% hike over the pair's previous five-year deal. Macquarie says that in 2014, broadcasters CBS, Fox and Comcast's (CMCSA) NBC will pay 46% to 60% more on average to carry their NFL games. While NFL Ticket is important to DirecTV's brand, Yong says its \"willingness to pay is much less this time compared to 2009, when the last deal was struck\". The satellite broadcaster is more focused on profit than on adding customers, Yong says. She also says that while DirecTV broadcasts entire games live, most cable TV rivals now offer NFL RedZone, a channel that shows highlights. The NFL has expanded its TV lineup to rake in more money. DirecTV has exclusive rights to all Sunday games, except for NBC's Sunday Night Football, which started airing in 2006. The NFL Network now sells Thursday night games to cable TV companies. Verizon Wireless, co-owned by Verizon Communications (VZ) and Vodafone (VOD), has rights to stream live Thursday, Sunday and Monday night games to its customers. Verizon charges subscribers about $5 a month to watch games on mobile devices. Mobile devices could play a part in DirecTV's negotiations. On its May 7 earnings call, DirecTV indicated it's interested in expanding its rights to NFL Sunday games to include streaming to mobile devices outside of homes. Analysts say DirecTV might opt to keep the NFL Ticket on", "label": "alpaca"}

{"text": "More like crepes, I came across this recipe one day at work while paging through an older issue of Food & Wine magazine on my lunch break. After having an amazing marzipan pudding made with semolina in Berlin (a recipe that will hopefully be up here soon), I've been obsessed with the idea of semolina. More specifically, the idea of semolina in places you wouldn't normally find it (i.e. outside the homemade pasta world). Luckily, this recipe was almost accidentally vegan! origination in Marrakech, crepes may not sound that interesting (okay, maybe that's a lie), but these are A-MAZING. The semolina gives it a really amazing texture, or rather, \"mouthfeel\" if you will (teehee). Without the eggs, vegan crepes and pancakes tend to be a bit flatter, but these are perfect in my opinion. In fact, I was so enamored with these after my first bite that I immediately went on Skype and gushed about how delicious they were, mouth full of food, for about 30 minutes. If you need more evidence, I finished the entire batter myself within 2 days. What's unique about these is that they have yeast. Thus, while cooking they get these little holes, which you can see in the picture below. Thus, it's almost like a flat crumpet. Perfect for catching fillings if you ask me! You only cook them on one side and after making the batter, it's a pretty simple ordeal. Yeah, you have to let the batter rise for an hour, but whatever, perfect time to do the dishes and check your e-mail! The recipe calls for mixing in a food processor and I'm not sure if it's really necessary. The semolina is already in flour form, so perhaps the only point is to break up lumps. I haven't tried it without the processor yet though, so if you do, chime in and let me know how it turns out! I'm sure a blender would work equally as well for this, as the batter is very liquidy.\n                // After the batter has rested, heat a non-stick pan over medium-high heat. Pour a ladleful of batter into the pan and let it cook for about two minutes on each side. Once golden, flip and add your desired topping. Continue until all the batter has been cooked. Serve with your favorite sweet syrup and enjoy! \n            </li>", "label": "alpaca"}

{"text": "The Chinese government has shown its distaste for North Korean leader Kim Jong-un's nuclear ambitions in recent weeks, going so far as to halt its support of the country. Beijing has been hesitant to place pressure on the North, out of fear of provoking a conflict, but has grown increasingly frustrated with the rogue nation. The Chinese public has been largely critical of the DPRK's actions, with calls to sanction the country increasing. Moreover, China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs has issued strong condemnations of recent DPRK actions and has pushed for a return to dialogue. Despite these statements, China has not taken any concrete action against its neighbor and has avoided providing the DPRK with additional aid or recognition. This is likely due to the fact that a unified Korea, under Seoul’s control, is seen as a potential threat to the Chinese in terms of national security. Furthermore, other nations are unwilling to take strong action against the DPRK because they fear retaliation from the powerful nation. As such, China is likely feeling the pressure to act and is seeking a diplomatic solution to the crisis.", "label": "alpaca"}

{"text": "The organization of interactions in complex systems can be described by network diagrams linking various components. These drawings provide useful representations of the local and global complexity of the underlying systems. The origin of their topological structure can be diverse, resulting from multiplying processes, optimization, or cost constraints. In spatial networks or those constrained by optimization, this latter process plays an important role in shaping their organization. By studying network designs resulting from a Pareto optimization process, this paper investigates the impact of different functional roles on different phase transitions associated with them. Distinct phases are connected with drastic changes in the network's topology, but these external constraints also determine the nature of these phase transitions. This further reinforces the view that phase transitions don't merely arise from intrinsic properties of a system alone, but from its interaction with its external limits.", "label": "alpaca"}

{"text": "I'm sure you've heard about the p5-mop project by now. If not, in a nutshell, p5-mop is an attempt to implement a subset of Moose into the core of Perl. Moose provides a Meta Object Protocol (MOP) to Perl. So does p5-mop, however p5-mop is implemented in a way that it can be properly included in the Perl core. Keep in mind that p5-mop goal is to implement a subset of Moose. As Stevan Little says:\n                We are not putting \"Moose into the core\" because Moose is too opinionated, instead we want to put a minimal and less opinionated MOP in the core that is capable of hosting something like Moose.\n                After a failed first attempt, Stevan Little restarted the p5-mop implementation: the so-called p5-mop-redux project, using Devel::Declare, (then Parse::Keyword) so that he can experiment and release often, while keeping the implementation core-friendly. Once he's happy with the features and all, he'll make sure it finds its way to the core.   \n                A small team (Stevan Little, Jesse Luehrs, and other contributors) is actively developping p5-mop, and Stevan is regularly blogging about it.\n                If you want more details about the failing first attempt, there is a bunch of backlog and mailing lists archive to read. However, here is how Stevan would summarize it:\n                We started the first prototype, not remembering the old adage of \"write the first one to throw away\" and I got sentimentally attached to my choice of design approach. This new approach (p5-mop-redux) was purposfully built with a firm commitment to keeping it as simple as possible, therefore making it simpler to hack on. Also, instead of making the MOP I always wanted, I approached as building the mop people actually needed (one that worked well with existing perl classes, etc).\n                Few months ago, when p5-mop-redux was announced, I tried to give it a go. And you should too! Because it's easy. Why is it important to try it out? It's important to have at least a vague idea of where p5-mop stands at, because this project is shaping a big part of Perl's future. IMHO, there will be a before and an after having a MOP in core. And it is being designed and tested right now. So as Perl users, it's our chance to have a look at it, test it, and provide feedback. Install itp5-mop is very easy to install:\n                you need at least perl 5.16. If you need to upgrade, consider perlbrew or plenv if you don't have cpanm, get it with curl -L http://cpanmin.us |perl - App::cpanminus first, we need to install twigils, with cpanm --dev twigils then p5-mop itself. If you're using github, just fork the p5-mop-redux project. Otherwise you can get", "label": "alpaca"}

People tend to use religion as an excuse to not believe in the paranormal, but there are many different religions and beliefs, and the Bible should not be taken as the word of God literally.

Religion does not make everything fact, and there is more to the Bible than what is written in the popular versions. Slavery is still not accepted by society and murder is not right, yet people still try to use religion to justify these practices. The Bible may have been the Word of God at some point, but it cannot be changed and the excuses these people use make no sense. There is no other way, and they should take a deeper look into the issues and discrepancies present in their religion.

One of my main responsibilities was to take Jewish college students on inspirational trips to Israel. For me, these trips were always especially meaningful, perhaps more so than for the students.One particularly memorable experience took place when I led the students on a visit to the Western Wall Tunnels. As we descended beneath the Old City of Jerusalem, I was absolutely floored by the sight of the magnificent limestone blocks beneath our feet – the very same stones that had served as the foundation of the Second Temple over two thousand years prior. The emotions of the moment were so powerful that I still remember it to this day. Esther Schlisser, our tour guide and an established expert on the Wall's history, instructed us to stay quiet and still as she shared the Wall's deep and ancient history with us. As we learned about the Wall's grandiosity under Herod the Great and walked the pathways of the Arab quarter, a particularly moving moment arrived when we all gathered and sat on the floor – the exact same floor on which great men and women had once paced. Esther began to weep, overwhelmed by the sheer magnitude of what we were standing in. I, too, felt the power of the moment, and was overcome with a mixture of emotions – awe, sadness, and a deep longing for the Wall to be returned to its previous glory. Esther's words still ring in my ears: \"These stones are alive. I miss my husband terribly, but I do not cry over something that is dead forever. I only cry when I think of what we have lost; what we could have had if only the walls of our Temple still stood.\" Though our temple has been destroyed and our people are exiled, in that moment I knew that I was standing on something special, something that could never be replaced, and a feeling that I still carry with me to this day.", "label": "alpaca"}

A computed tomography scan revealed tracheobronchial stenosis due to advanced esophageal cancer with tracheal invasion, prompting the creation of a tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF). To manage his condition, the patient underwent tracheobronchial stenting and chemoradiotherapy, but a large TEF developed after irradiation (18 Gy) and chemotherapy, making it difficult for him to eat. Our hospital then performed esophageal bypass surgery using a gastric conduit, with a percutaneous cardiopulmonary support system prepared for the risk of airway obstruction during anesthesia.

{"text": "Nature is essential to human survival and serves as both a resource and a regulator of social life. Since Marx, we know that what distinguishes and characterizes societies is the way in which they organize the production, distribution, and use of the material and symbolic resources they possess. In other words, the mode of production is what shapes the actual form of material life. It involves specific forms of relationships between the tools, raw materials, labour force, product, ownership, and dependencies. In each of these relationships, man is connected to other men and to nature through material means that are the result of social labour. This means that there is both a natural and a social dimension to all production. Both the production of a hut or a city, a field or a road, an axe or a dump truck, is only possible through the transformation of nature, and societies differ in how they do so. For example, previously rural-based modes of production have drastically changed their environment to ensure their own reproduction. In contrast, capitalism reorganizes production to increase value, creating an ever-increasing disparity between humans and nature.", "label": "alpaca"}

A total of 101 serum samples were collected from patients and were stored at -20°C. DNA was extracted from serum by an extraction kit. The extracted DNA was tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for detection of HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 pol and tax gene sequences, respectively. Samples were collected from 67 (66.33%), 20 (19.80%), 4 (3.96%), and 10 (9.90%) patients with thalassemia, leukemia, lymphoma and hemophilia, respectively. \n\nResults\nOne thalassemia sample was HTLV-positive, but none of the samples contained the genome of HTLV-2. The prevalence of HTLV- in this study in patients with hematological disorders was 0.09%.\n\nConclusions\nThe prevalence of HTLV- in hematological disorders was similar to that of other parts of Iran. The present study revealed that HTLV- screening should be performed before blood transfusion to reduce the risk of virus transmission in patients with hematological disorders. More studies should be performed to detect these viruses in blood donors.", "label": "alpaca"}

This was criticized as potentially opening the EU to unjustified regulatory competition and a ‘race to the bottom’ in standards, as exemplified by the US, where the state of Delaware attracts most companies with its weakest accountability standards and low corporate taxes.\n\n                \n                In Centros Ltd v Erhversus-og Selkabssyrelsen, the Court of Justice found that a UK limited company operating in Denmark could not be required to comply with Denmark’s minimum share capital rules. UK law only required £1 of capital to start a company, while Denmark’s legislature took the view that companies should only be started up with 200,000kr( around €27,000) to protect creditors if the company failed and went insolvent. The Court of Justice held that Denmark’s minimum capital law infringed Centros Ltd’s freedom of establishment and could not be justified, as it imposed requirements for the formation of a company that went beyond what was necessary.\n\n                \n                In Überseering BV v Nordic Construction GmbH, the Court of Justice held that a German court could not deny a Dutch building company the right to enforce a contract in Germany on the basis that it was not validly incorporated in Germany. Although restrictions on freedom of establishment could be justified by creditor protection, labour rights to participate in work, or the public interest in collecting taxes, denial of capacity went too far: it was an “outright negation” of the right of establishment. \n\n                \n                In Cartesio Oktató és Szolgáltató bt, the Court of Justice affirmed that because corporations are created by law, they are in principle subject to any rules for formation that a state of incorporation wishes to impose. This meant that the Hungarian authorities could prevent a company from shifting its central administration to Italy while it still operated and was incorporated in Hungary.

In this work, we propose a new experimental scheme for engineering such topological superconductors. By manipulating the superlattice structure of organic molecules placed on top of a superconductor with Rashba spin-orbit coupling, topological superconducting phases can be achieved without fine-tuning the chemical potential. Moreover, superconductors with different Chern numbers can be obtained by changing the superlattice structure of the organic molecules.", "label": "alpaca"}

In particular, we study the hypermultiplet moduli space of a heterotic string on a K3 surface. One application of this machinery reveals that Type IIB strings compactified on a space suffer from worldsheet instantons, spacetime instantons and, in addition, \"mixed\" instantons which are both worldsheet and spacetime. As another application, we look at the hyperkhler limit of the moduli space in which the K3 surface becomes an elliptic space. This is a variant of the \"geometric engineering\" method used for vector multiplet moduli space and should be applicable to a wide range of examples.

{"text": "We investigate the properties of 224 broad absorption line quasars (BalQsos) selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Early Data Release (SDSS-EDR). We find that BalQsos are significantly reddened compared to the average quasar, in agreement with previous studies. High-ionization BalQsos also show a higher degree of reddening compared to normal quasars. Assuming a SMC-like dust reddening at the quasar's redshift, the amount of reddening needed to explain the differences between BalQsos and normal quasars is approximately 1.0 and 2.0 for low- and high-ionization BalQsos, respectively, compared to the ensemble average of the entire quasar sample. \n  \nWe find that there are differences in the emission line properties between the average Hibal, LoBal and NonBalQso. These differences, together with differences in the absorption line troughs, may be related to intrinsic quasar properties such as the slope of the intrinsic (unreddened) continuum. Despite the differences among BalQso sub-types and NonBalQsos, BalQsos appear to be drawn from the same parent population as NonBalQsos when both are selected by their UV/Optical properties. We find that the overall fraction of traditionally defined BalQsos, after correcting for color-dependent selection effects due to different SEDs of BalQso and NonBalQsos, is 3.4% and shows no significant redshift dependence for $z \\in [1.9-3.0].

{"text": "Multipoint or multichannel observations of plasmas can sometimes be modeled as an instantaneous mixture of contributions (waves, emissions, etc.) of different origins. Recovering the individual sources from their mixture then becomes one of the key objectives. Unfortunately, this can be a highly underdetermined problem unless the underlying mixing processes are well known. Blind source separation seeks to disentangle such mixtures with the least possible prior information on the sources and their mixing processes. Several powerful approaches have recently been developed which can often provide new or deeper insight into the underlying physics. This tutorial paper discusses some possible applications of blind source separation to the field of plasma physics, which is still largely unexplored. Two examples are presented. The first shows how concurrent processes in the electron temperature's dynamic response can be isolated. The second example deals with solar spectral imaging in the extreme ultraviolet, and demonstrates how empirical temperature maps can be constructed.", "label": "alpaca"}

{"text": "The Bering Strait is a waterway that divides Russia from North America. It lies above the Bering Land Bridge, also known as Beringia, a submerged landmass that connected the Siberian mainland with North America. While its exact shape and size differ depending on the publication, most scholars agree that it encompassed the Seward Peninsula, in addition to existing land areas of northeast Siberia and western Alaska, between the Verkhoyansk Range in Siberia and the Mackenzie River in Alaska. As a waterway, the Bering Strait connects the Pacific Ocean to the Arctic Ocean over the polar ice cap, and eventually the Atlantic Ocean. \n\n                  During its highest standing, the Bering Land Bridge was a hospitable tundra or steppe-tundra environment. But during the Last Glacial Maximum, 30,000-18,000 years ago, the BLB was partially or completely submerged, making it an obstacle for travelers. \n\n                  Archaeological evidence suggests that people first moved from Siberia into North America via the BLB. The earliest sites to the west of the Bering Land Bridge east of the Verkhoyansk Range in Siberia are the Yana RHS site, dating back 30,000 years. This confirms the hypothesis that people were \"trapped\" on the BLB for millennia during the Last Glacial Maximum. \n\n                  Today, the BLB is primarily a body of water, although some parts still remain above sea level and are accessible. Scientists are still studying its shape and size in order to better understand the first American colonization.", "label": "alpaca"}
{"text": "Ketamine has been reported to reduce suicidal ideation (SI) in patients with depression, however its efficacy and safety have yet to be established in rigorous, clinical research. Publications retrieved from the PubMed and Cochrane databases between January 2015 to present were searched for articles examining the effect of therapeutic ketamine administration on SI. A total of nine publications (six clinical trials and three case reports) met the search criteria and were analysed. The results showed rapid and significant reduction in SI with ketamine administration, similar to previously described data on ketamine and treatment-resistant depression. A total of 137 patients with SI have been reported in the literature receiving therapeutic ketamine. Seven studies administered a dose of 0.5 mg/kg intravenously over 40 minutes, while one study administered a 0.2 mg/kg intravenous bolus and another study administered a liquid suspension. The earliest significant results were seen 40 minutes after administration, and the longest effects were observed up to 10 days post-infusion. The studies reported no significant side effects in the majority of patients, with the most frequent adverse events being mild sedation and dissociative effects.  Conclusions: The preliminary evidence suggests that ketamine reduces SI in patients with depression, with a favorable risk-benefit ratio. Additional studies are needed to further investigate its mechanism of action, long-term outcomes, and long-term adverse effects (including abuse) and benefits. In addition, ketamine could potentially be used as a prototype for further development of rapid-acting antisuicidal medication with a practical route of administration and the most favorable risk-benefit ratio.", "label": "alpaca"}

Although the 22q11.2 deletion is not found in all patients with a 22q11.2 ds phenotype, other chromosomal aberrations and/or mutations in the T-box 1 transcription factor C (TBX1) gene have been detected in some patients. Animal models with mutations in the Fibroblast Growth Factor 8 (FGF8) gene have produced a similar phenotype, but FGF8 mutations have not yet been investigated in humans. In this study, we tested a strategy of laboratory testing for reducing costs in the investigation of patients presenting with 22q11.2 ds. A total of 109 individuals with a clinical suspicion of the syndrome were investigated with cytogenetic banding, fluorescence in situ hybridization, and/or multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. A conclusive diagnosis was achieved in 33 of 109 (30.2%) cases. In addition, mutations in the coding regions of TBX1 and FGF8 genes were investigated in selected cases where 22q11.2 deletion had been excluded, and no pathogenic mutations were detected in both genes. This study presents a strategy for molecular genetic characterization of patients with 22q11.2 ds using different laboratory techniques which could be useful in different countries according to local resources. To our knowledge, this is the first investigation of FGF8 gene in humans with this clinical suspicion.", "label": "alpaca"}

These modes probe the deep stellar interior and offer a detailed fingerprint of their structure. Four-year high-precision Space-based Kepler photometry of XMath1dor stars has become available, allowing us to study them with unprecedented detail. We selected, analysed, and characterized a sample of 67 XMath1dor stars for which we have Kepler observations available. For all the targets in the sample, we assembled high-resolution spectroscopy to confirm their F-type nature. We found 14 binaries, among which four single-lined binaries, five double-lined binaries, two triple systems, and three binaries with no detected radial velocity variations. We estimated the orbital parameters whenever possible. For the single stars and the single-lined binaries, fundamental parameter values were determined from spectroscopy. We searched for period spacing patterns in the photometric data and identified this diagnostic for 50 of the stars in the sample, 46 of which are single stars or single-lined binaries. We found a strong correlation between the spectroscopic XMath2 and the period spacing values, confirming the influence of rotation on XMath1dor-type pulsations as predicted by theory. We also found relations between the dominant g-mode frequency, the longest pulsation period detected in series of prograde modes, XMath3, and XMath2.", "label": "alpaca"}

This article focuses on one important aspect of the hospital's longevity and particular character, or organisational culture: the ethos of a Mccord family, integral to which were faith and a commitment to service. While recognising that families, including hospital families like that at Mccord, are contentious social constructs, with deeply embedded hierarchies and inequalities based on race, class and gender, we also consider how the notion of a Mccord family was experienced and shared in complex ways. Indeed, during the twentieth century, this ethos was avidly promoted by the hospital's founders and managers, and by a wide variety of employees and trainees. It also extended to people at a far geographical remove from Durban. Moreover, this ethos became so powerful that many patients felt that it shaped their convalescence experience positively. This article considers how this family ethos was constructed and what made it so attractive to this hospital's staff, trainees and patients. Furthermore, we consider what work it did for this mission hospital, especially in promoting bonds of multi-racial unity in the contexts of segregation and apartheid society. More broadly, it suggests that critical histories of the ways in which individuals, hospitals, faith and families intersect may be of value for the future of hospitals, as well as of interest in their past.", "label": "alpaca"}

The model has already been applied to Lyman-alpha absorption spectra towards nearby stars, as well as Solar and Heliospheric Observatory/SWAN data. Katushkina et al. (this issue) used the model results to analyze IBEX-Lo data. Additionally, the model has been developed in such a way that any numerical diffusion or reconnection across the heliopause was not allowed. The heliospheric current sheet is a rotational discontinuity in the ideal MHD model, and can be treated kinematically, allowing for a more accurate description of the SW-LISM interaction.

{"text": "Subclass H1 influenza viruses derived from the human seasonal lineage have been isolated from North American swine since 2003. The objective of this work was to study the pathogenesis and transmission of these viruses in swine, comparing three isolates from different phylogenetic subclusters, geographic locations, and years of isolation. \n                     Two isolates from the −Cluster, A/Sw/MN/07002083/07 (Mn07) and A/Sw/IL/00685/05 (Il05) viruses, and A/Sw/TX/01976/08 (Tx08) from the 1 Subcluster, caused disease and were transmitted to contact pigs. Respiratory disease was apparent in pigs infected with Mn07 and Il05 viruses, although clinical signs and lung lesions were reduced in severity when compared to Tx08. On day 5 following infection, Mn07-infected pigs had lower virus titers than Tx08 pigs, suggesting that although this H1N1 was successfully transmitted, it may not replicate as efficiently in the upper or lower respiratory tract. Mn07 and Il05 H1N1 induced higher serum antibody titers than Tx08. Greater serological cross-reactivity was observed for viruses from the same haplotypic subcluster; however, antigenic differences between the subclusters may have implications for disease control strategies for pigs.", "label": "alpaca"}

{"text": "We propose a method for incorporating correlations into the impact parameter space description of multiple (semi-)hard partonic collisions in high energy hadron-hadron scattering. The perturbative QCD input is the standard factorization theorem for inclusive dijet production with a lower cutoff on transverse momentum. The width of the transverse distribution of hard partons is then fixed by parameterizations of the two-gluon formfactor. We then reconstruct the hard contribution to the total inelastic profile function and obtain corrections due to correlations to the more commonly used eikonal description. Estimates of the size of double correlation corrections are based on the rate of double collisions measured at the Tevatron. We find that, if typical values for the lower transverse momentum cutoff are used in the calculation of the inclusive hard dijet cross section, then the correlation corrections are necessary for maintaining consistency with expectations for the total inelastic proton-proton cross section at LHC energies.", "label": "alpaca"}

A probabilistic Turing machine is a deterministic Turing machine with the additional factor of randomness, introducing the potential for more efficient solutions to problems. Randomized algorithms that use this additional randomness can perform better than their deterministic counterparts. A non-deterministic Turing machine is a deterministic Turing machine with the element of choice, allowing multiple possible paths for the Turing machine to take when moving forward, allowing for more potential solutions to be explored. This model is not intended to be physically realised, but serves as an interesting abstraction which can lead to complexity classes such as non-deterministic algorithms.

Using the Geant4 modeling of the detector, the interactions of atmospheric neutrinos with target nuclei are simulated. The detector response to hadrons propagating through it is investigated by studying the number of hits in the active detector elements. The detector response to charged pions of a fixed energy is studied first, followed by the average response to the hadrons produced in atmospheric neutrino interactions using events simulated with the Nuance event generator. The shape of the hit distribution is observed to fit the Vavilov distribution, which reduces to a Gaussian at high energies. In terms of the parameters of this distribution, we present the hadron energy resolution as a function of hadron energy, and the calibration of hadron energy as a function of the hit multiplicity. The energy resolution for hadrons is found to be in the range 85% (for 1 GeV) to 36% (for 15 GeV).", "label": "alpaca"}

To rectify this, we use the Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem to determine the appropriate size of the Langevin terms and thus obtain the required consistency. Fluctuations of the electromagnetic potential are essential even when quantities that do not depend directly on it are being evaluated. Our method can be cast in a gauge-invariant form and applied to evaluate paraconductivity of a superconducting wire. \n                    \n                We have conducted numerous tests and all results are consistent with statistical mechanics.

{"text": "Ever since the UPA government mooted the Sethusamudram Shipping Canal Project (SSCP) in 2004, it has been a target of criticism from environmental advocates as well as religious enthusiasts. The project envisages excavating the shallow sea between the Palk Bay and the Gulf of Mannar to create a narrow shipping passage, linking the east and west coasts of India and obviating the current ‘hassle’ of circumnavigating Sri Lanka to reach the eastern coast of India (and vice-versa).The total length of the channel is estimated to be 152.2 km. Creating it will require two phases of dredging (or even blasting, depending on the nature of the substratum) the 20-km-long coral-reef platform known as ‘Adam’s Bridge’ or ‘Ram Sethu’, as some like to call it, and the 54-km long Bay of Bengal segments. The third segment falls in the Palk Bay, with a total length of 78 km and which reportedly requires no dredging as this area has a clearance depth of 12 m.Sethusamudram, as the name suggests, is that part of the ocean being constantly bridged by natural sedimentation processes. Like the Great Barrier Reef off of the northeast coast of Australia, Ram Sethu is a continuous stretch of limestone shoals that runs from the Pamban island near Rameswaram to Mannar Island off of the northern coast of Sri Lanka. Because the ocean floor is shallow in this area, natural processes have formed coral platforms here for millions of years.During a glaciation period 20,000 years ago, many parts of the Indian coast including, parts of Sethusamudram, may have been exposed above water. From 20,000 years ago until 6,000 years ago, seas level steadily rose around the world due to glaciers melting. As it did, the coral polyps could once again have grown higher on the newly submerged platforms. And in time, the platforms may have been used by human migrants to cross over the oceans. The Indian epic Ramayana refers to a putative land bridge in this region; believers hold it as the structure that Lord Ram and his army built to reach Lanka.An initially assessment by the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) ruled out any environmental risk and certified the feasibility of the project. However, serious concerns have been raised from different quarters on the stability of the proposed canal and the environmental impact of this project. Its total cost is Rs 25,000 crore.Government agencies entrusted with this work at that time seemed to show an extraordinary enthusiasm, brushing aside uncomfortable questions and keeping the public in the dark about the canal’s stability and adverse environmental impact.", "label": "alpaca"}

We evaluate the time-dependent Casimir-Polder force on the atom and find that it shows an oscillatory behavior from attractive to repulsive both in time and in space. We also investigate the asymptotic behavior in time of the dynamical force and of related local field quantities, showing that the static value of the force, as obtained by a time-independent approach, is recovered for times much larger than the timescale of the atomic self-dressing, but smaller than the atomic decay time. We then discuss the evolution of global quantities such as atomic and field energies, and their asymptotic behavior. We also compare our results for the dynamical force on the excited atom with analogous results recently obtained for an initially bare ground state atom. We show that new relevant features are obtained in the case of an initially excited atom, for example much larger values of the dynamical force with respect to the static one, allowing for an easier way to single out and observe the dynamical Casimir-Polder effect.", "label": "alpaca"}

While the dive play has generally been successful for the Cowboys so far this season, they opted to keep the ball, hoping that Prescott could execute their signature read-option play that they’ve been running with success throughout the season.The problem for the Cowboys, however, was that Green Bay had now learned of their passing tendencies and had set up a specific defense to counter it with Sam Shields lining up on the other side of the field, blanketing the side of the field where the Cowboys intended to pass and forcing Prescott to turn to his other option - running it himself. But instead of just running to the side that was vacated by Shields, Prescott elected to run to the opposite corner, drawing the attention of the Packers’ defense and leaving his other options wide open - all this despite having Cole Beasley wide open for the pass.The Packers, who were playing catch up with the Cowboys until then, now had the momentum, and subsequently took the lead and eventually won the game.

{"text": "13 August 2013\n                Chapters 1-12 \n                I'm impressed with this novel all over again. It's decades since I read it, and one of the things I'd forgotten is how rounded a character Darcy is. In my mind, fed by at least three different television adaptations over the years, his early appearances are characterised by his unforgivable snobbishness, and dismissiveness of almost everything and everyone he encounters. In fact, it's much more complicated than that. And more interesting. Everybody – including me – thinks they know the arc of the storyline. It's as well-known, and as straightforward, as Romeo and Juliet, with mutual dislike replacing love at first sight. Wrong. There is dislike but, following a single disastrous evening, it is all on Elizabeth's side. She is the one whose pride is piqued, so that despite several days spent in the same house as Darcy – tell you later – she sees only hauteur and self-importance while Austen makes sure that the reader is seeing something quite different. She does this by telling us exactly what is going through Darcy's mind at crucial moments. I was astonished to realise that she makes it absolutely clear what is going on as early as Chapter 6. By their second meeting, following the famously awful first encounter in Chapter 4, he is finding her face'rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes' and other discoveries 'equally mortifying' concerning her figure and easy manner. Meanwhile, in the same paragraph, Austen describes Elizabeth as 'perfectly unaware' of this, only remembering how 'he had not considered her handsome enough to dance with.' Austen has prepared us for this pride in the previous chapter, by having Elizabeth spelling it out for her friend Charlotte (and for us): 'I could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine.' Of course, mortification is an aspect of Darcy's complex feelings as well. He doesn't want any of this, for the absolutely straightforward reason that any connection between him and her, based on their relative status in the strata of Regency society, is impossible. End of story. Except, of course, it isn't. By Chapter 10, after she's been at Bingley's house for some days looking after her sister Jane, he 'had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her. He really believed, that were it not for the inferiority of her connections, he should be in some danger.' This is Jane Austen doing that thing she always does in the early chapters: she makes it absolutely clear to the reader what it is that her main characters will have to learn, or un-learn, in order to find happiness. Through those careful revelations, placed alongside scenes showing the characters in action, she makes sure that the reader always knows them better than they know themselves. Darcy's fundamental error we know about: he is certain that Elizabeth isn't good enough for him socially. Meanwhile Elizabeth, whose judgments otherwise are always shown to be right, is blind to qualities in Darcy that Austen makes sure we notice. He sees through the", "label": "alpaca"}

But other traits may lead to a strain bred entirely for aesthetic appeal, such as the diminutive Falabella horse.\n\nIf domestic cats were bred for their functionality, only those which were proven hunters of vermin would be selected for controlled breeding. However, domestic cats are selectively bred as pets. Breeders seek to improve them according to aesthetic criteria while not adversely affecting health or temperament. However, human curiosity has often led breeders to look for novelties or curiosities which might not be viable in a natural environment. These are viable in a commercial environment.\n\nThis is not to say that cat-breeders are purely financially motivated. Most seek to improve upon the traits of existing breeds, for example to develop a better coat in Persian cats, to expand the colour range of another breed, to eliminate the incidence of hereditary illness in a breed etc. Some seek to perfect a body type - if the short nose of a Persian is desirable, then extreme flat faces are even more desirable as the ultimate expression of short-nosedness.\n\nRoger Tabor in his text \"The Rise of The Cat\" (1991) said that when selection was made for showing purposes, \"genetic disasters occurred\".

The genius of the movie was that it focused on the music rather than the story of Enrico Caruso, who was arguably the greatest opera singer of all time. This focus allowed MGM to cast the incredible singing and acting talents of Mario Lanza, who was able to bring Caruso’s iconic music to life. As a result, the movie captivated audiences and has remained one of the most sought-after titles on eBay, often selling for as little as $2.

{"text": "Infrared (IR) light is important for a variety of applications, such as short-range wireless communication, thermal sensing, spectroscopy, material processing, medical surgery and astronomy. However, IR light is much more difficult to transport than optical light or microwave radiation. Existing hollow-core IR waveguides usually use a layer of metallic coating on the inner wall of the waveguide to reflect guided light. Unfortunately, this metallic layer unfortunately absorbs the guided light significantly due to its finite Ohmic loss, especially for transverse-magnetic (TM) light. \n\nIn this paper, we show that metal-wire based metamaterials may serve as an efficient TM reflector, reducing propagation loss of the TM mode by two orders of magnitude. By further imposing a conventional metal cladding layer, which reflects specifically transverse-electric (TE) light, we can potentially obtain a low-loss hollow-core fiber.

Scaling analysis of the radius of gyration showed that the chains were extended at low polymer concentrations and small Bjerrum lengths, while at sufficiently large Bjerrum lengths, the chains shrunk to produce compact structures with exponents smaller than a Gaussian chain, suggesting the presence of attractive interchain interactions.  Careful study of the radial distribution function of the center of mass of the polyelectrolyte chains showed clear evidence that effective interchain attractive interactions also exist in solutions of flexible polyelectrolytes, similar to what has been found for rod-like polyelectrolytes.  Our results suggest that the broad maximum observed in scattering experiments is due to clustering of chains.", "label": "alpaca"}

{"text": "In this study, antibodies from la Cueva de los Muertos Chiquitos (CMc) people, who lived in present day Durango and Zacatecas in Mexico, were tested for two protozoan parasites - Toxoplasma gondii and Trypanosoma cruzi - using ELISA tests. Human antibodies created in response to these two parasites can be detected in modern saliva using ELISA kits intended for use with human serum. To ensure accurate results, quids were reconstituted and subjected to the tests. Unfortunately, all test wells yielded negative results. This could be due to improper methods, as there is no precedent for this work in the existing literature. However, it could also be a simple matter of parasite absence among those people who occupied CMc. Additionally, a final consideration is the taphonomy of human antibodies and whether or not ELISA is a sufficient method for recovering antibodies from archaeological contexts. Additionally, an ELISA test targeting secretory IGA (SIGA) was conducted to further evaluate the failure to detect parasite-induced antibodies from quids. Herein, the methods used for quid preparation and ELISA procedures are described so that they can be further developed by future researchers. The results are discussed in light of the potential future of quid analysis.", "label": "alpaca"}

{"text": "Recent discoveries of stars like SMSS J031300.36-670839.3 have greatly enhanced our understanding of the universe’s earliest stars. These stars possess unusually low levels of carbon, reflecting the chemical conditions after the first supernova explosion. This has allowed us to gain deeper insights into the formation of these stars and how they compare to more common second-generation stars.\n\nWe now present the first set of cosmological simulations that include a detailed chemical network, including primordial species as well as carbon, oxygen, silicon, and their various isotopes. The simulations follow the formation of carbon-enhanced metal-poor stars, finding that background UV radiation and metals both play a role in the collapse of the gas. We find that higher metallicities can lead to lower-mass stars, with radiative backgrounds playing a less important role than metals in delaying the collapse of the gas.

Not only is Jacoby's performance as Hamlet worth the effort, but Patrick Stewart's turn as Claudius is equally unmissable. The four and a half hours of runtime proves to be an ideal fit for the play, allowing all of its emotions, intricacies and twists to be expressed. Every version of \"Hamlet\" has its own unique structure; Olivier focusing more on indecision and Gibson on passion. Jacoby succeeds in tying all of these pieces together with Shakespeare's entire script in full.\n\n                Why does Hamlet delay in avenging his father's murder? He tells his mother that he is \"very proud, revengeful, ambitious...\". His rage and grief over his father's death, and his mother's untimely remarriage to his uncle, is only compounded by the knowledge that Claudius has usurped his rightful throne. However, he also knows that murdering the King could result in him losing his own throne. He is so driven that he cannot act immediately; instead he seeks proof of his uncle's wickedness and waits for a perfect moment to claim his vengeance. But this is only the start of his tragedy. He knows that by demanding justice he will also receive damnation for his soul - a heavy burden for a weary prince. In the end, it is this overreaching ambition for complete retribution and justice which ultimately destroys him, as he is not able to act in time.", "label": "alpaca"}

{"text": "The data of physical contacts and face-to-face communications suggests that temporal networks can be more effective media through which infections spread among humans and animals. This complex dynamic is further complicated by the complexity of both the network structure and the temporal dimensions. Theoretic approaches are needed to identify key factors that influence the dynamics of epidemics. In particular, which factors make some temporal networks more conducive to infection than others is still a debate. \n\nWe develop a theory to understand the Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) model on arbitrary temporal networks, where each contact occurs over a finite duration. We show that temporality of the network reduces the epidemic threshold, making it easier for infections to persist on temporal networks when compared to their static counterparts. We further show that the commutator bracket of the adjacency matrices at different times is a key determinant of the epidemic threshold in temporal networks. The effect of temporality on the epidemic threshold, which depends on a dataset, can be roughly predicted by the magnitude of a commutator norm.", "label": "alpaca"}

{"text": "Identifying the processes that determine the rate of protostellar mass growth is an important element for any star formation theory. To investigate this, I used numerical models that follow the evolution of molecular cloud regions from turbulent fragmentation to the formation of star clusters. The results indicate that the rate of protostellar mass accretion, @xmath0, can vary significantly depending on the environment. In dense clusters, it is highly time-varying and is influenced by the mutual interaction of protostellar cores and the competition for accretion from the common cluster gas reservoir. High-mass stars build up in the central parts of dense, cluster-forming cloud regions and begin to form in the early phases of cluster evolution. They continue to grow at a high rate until the available gas is exhausted or expelled by feedback. Lower-mass stars tend to form at later phases and @xmath0 declines rapidly after a short initial phase of strong growth. I present a simple fit formula for the time evolution of the average @xmath0 for protostars of different masses in a dense cluster environment.", "label": "alpaca"}

Immediately after the infusion, 1% propofol 2 mg/kg was injected over 25 seconds. The patients were assessed for pain every 5 seconds until they lost consciousness. The pain score was evaluated using the McCrindle and Hunter scale.\n  Results showed that the incidence of Propofol injection pain (PIP) and moderate/severe Propofol injection pain (MS-PIP) was significantly higher in Group K compared to Group D (79.6% and 16.7%, respectively). Additionally, no patient in Group D had any reports of pain with propofol injection. The incidence of hypertension and tachycardia was also significantly higher in Group K compared to Group D (p = 0.027). \n  In conclusion, our study suggests that a single dose of dexmedetomidine 0.5g/kg is effective in decreasing the incidence of Propofol injection pain and its severity, without having any significant adverse effects.

{"text": "We propose a mechanism for the origin of the Galactic Ridge X-ray Background (GRB) that naturally explains its observed properties. Specifically, we consider the detection of the “centroid line” energy below 6.7 keV, which is difficult to explain in the traditional model, and the apparent broadness of the line, which is related to the acceleration of electrons up to relativistic energies in the supernova remnants.\n\nWe propose a mixed plasma model of thermal and non-thermal components. The thermal plasma could originate from supernova remnants, while the non-thermal emission comes from the interactions between cosmic rays and the interstellar medium. Furthermore, atomic collisions of fast electrons produce characteristic non-thermal, narrow X-ray emission lines that can explain the complex GRB spectrum.\n\nUsing the ASCA GIS archival data in the Scutum Arm region, we fit a two-temperature thermal plasma model with kT1 and kT2keV, plus a lecre (low energy cosmic ray electrons) component. The best-fitting model successfully explains the data and excludes a purely non-thermal origin for the emission, as well as a significant contribution from low energy cosmic ray ions, which would produce excessive nuclear X-ray line emission and a higher production rate of galactic-wide diffuse γ-rays. Overall, our analysis provides a viable explanation of the origin and properties of the GRB, while resolving the difficulties associated with previous interpretations of the data.", "label": "alpaca"}

{"text": "Historic England found further evidence of Roman army camps, Iron Age/Roman settlements and a prehistoric henge, as well as a medieval farmstead, dry-summer agricultural fields, and the remains of a lime kiln and monastic grange.  Aerial photographs revealed crop marks in Comberton that showed the extent of the Iron Age/Roman settlement, and in Coventry, the ruined bomb shelter of the Second World War was visible in Radford Road's recreation ground despite being partly demolished. The distinctively shaped playing cards of the Roman camp were particularly visible in fields across Cumbria, Cambridgeshire, Dorset, East Yorkshire, Buckinghamshire, Suffolk, West Sussex and West Midlands. The unusual prehistoric site in Killington was discovered with the help of low winter sunlight, revealing a central feature thought to be a \"henge\" and an area used for agricultural purposes throughout centuries. The Bronze Age barrows in Killington were also uncovered by the dry summer, and the earth-covered ruins of buildings and tracks leading to neighbouring farms were also found. The remains of a medieval farmstead were also discovered, proving how generations of families had lived off the land. The crop marks in the pictures showed the ancient burial site in Comberton, the Medieval monastic farm in Coventry and the dry-summer agricultural fields in Cumbria, Cambridgeshire, Dorset, East Yorkshire, Buckinghamshire, Suffolk, West Sussex and West Midlands.

{"text": "The molecular mechanisms and signalling cascades that trigger the induction of Group I Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor (Gi-MGLUR)-dependent long-term depression (LTD) have been the subject of intensive investigation for nearly two decades. The generation of genetically modified animals has played a crucial role in elucidating the involvement of key molecules regulating the induction and maintenance of Gi-MGLUR-LTD. \n\nRecently, it has been shown that the absence of MK2 impaired the induction of Gi-MGLUR-dependent LTD, an effect that is caused by reduced internalization of AMPA receptors (AMPAR). As the MK2 cascade directly regulates Tumor Necrosis Factor-Alpha (TNF) production, this review will examine the evidence that the release of TNF acts to regulate Glutamate Receptor expression and therefore may play a functional role in the impairment of Gi-MGLUR-dependent LTD and the cognitive deficits observed in MK2/3 double knockout animals. \n\nThe strong links of increased TNF production in both aging and neurodegenerative disease could implicate the action of MK2 in these processes.", "label": "alpaca"}

{"text": "This study aimed to address the discrepancies in the literature regarding the prevalence of euphoria in MS patients.  The classical authors describe euphoria as the predominant mood state of MS patients, while more contemporary authors regard it as rare.  To investigate this, one hundred MS patients and one hundred matched controls were interviewed using the Cottrell and Wilson criteria and the Neuropsychiatric Inventory.  Results showed the MS group demonstrating high frequencies of euphoria using the classical measure, yet low frequencies using the modern measure.  The matched control group demonstrated significantly higher rates for euphoria using the classical measure and lower rates for euphoria using the modern measure.  Thus, these results suggest that the discrepancies noted in the literature do not reflect a change in the incidence of euphoria in MS, but rather a discrepancy in the definition and operationalization of euphoria.  Furthermore, these results highlight the importance of characterizing what represents pathological euphoria and the need for better definitions and instruments of measure.", "label": "alpaca"}

{"text": "Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by various pathological and clinical manifestations. Cognitive dysfunction, a frequent yet non-motor complication, is a risk factor for poor prognosis and displays inter-individual variation in its progression.\n \n \n The largest study to identify biomarkers of PD progression, the Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI), recently published its baseline characteristics. Previously, the diagnostic utility of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers such as α-Synuclein (Sn), total tau, phosphorylated tau at Thr181 and amyloid 1-42 was unsatisfactory.  However, the PPMI study showed that the baseline data on CSF biomarkers suggest that their measurement may enable the prediction of future cognitive decline in PD patients.\n\n \n To further explore the neuropathological nature of the heterogeneous cognitive decline in PD, this review discusses the data from the PPMI study and explains the implications of this research. We argue that longitudinal observational studies are needed to prove the hypothesis that the interaction between Alzheimer’s pathology and Sn pathology is important in the progression of cognitive dysfunction in PD.  We further conclude that the combination of clinical, biochemical, genetic and imaging biomarkers of PD could be a feasible strategy for predicting the heterogeneous progression of PD.", "label": "alpaca"}

It is an ongoing debate whether DWI at 7 T can be properly performed in patients, and a systematic SNR comparison for Multiband Spin-Echo EPI between 3 T and 7 T has not been methodically studied.\n\nThe goal of this study was to use MBEPI at 7 T in order to obtain 90° multi-shell DWI within a clinically feasible acquisition time for patients with glioma. This study included an SNR comparison between 3 T and 7 T, and the application of B1 mapping and distortion correction procedures for reducing the impact of variations in B0 and B1. The optimized Multiband sequence was applied in 20 patients with glioma to generate both DTI and NodDI maps for comparison of values in tumor and normal appearing white matter (NAWM).\n\nOur SNR analysis showed that MBEPI at 7 T was comparable to that at 3 T, and the data quality acquired in patients was clinically acceptable. NodDI maps provided unique contrast within the t2 lesion that was not seen in anatomical images or DTI maps. Such contrast may reflect the complexity of tissue compositions associated with disease progression and treatment effects. \n\nThe ability to consistently obtain high quality diffusion data at 7 T will contribute towards the implementation of a comprehensive brain MRI examination at ultra-high field.", "label": "alpaca"}

{"text": "The production of W bosons in association with jets is an important background to new physics at the LHC. Events in which the W carries large transverse momentum and decays leptonically lead to large missing energy and are of particular importance. We show that the left-handed nature of the W boson coupling, combined with valence quark domination at a proton-proton collider, leads to a large left-handed polarization for both W and Z bosons at large transverse momenta. The polarization fractions are very stable with respect to QCD corrections. The leptonic decay of the W bosons translates the common left-handed polarization into a strong asymmetry in transverse momentum distributions between positrons and electrons, and between neutrinos and anti-neutrinos (missing transverse energy). Such asymmetries may provide an effective experimental handle on separating W+jets from top quark production, which exhibits very little asymmetry due to C invariance, and from various types of new physics.", "label": "alpaca"}

{"text": "The most common complaints of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS) are sensory components, but motor deficits also impede the functional status of the hand. Unlike the evaluation of sensory function, the objective, quantitative evaluation of median nerve motor function is not as easy.\n\n            To objectively measure the motor function of the median nerve, a load cell and computer-based measurement system was used. All measurements were made in individuals diagnosed with idiopathic CTS by clinical features and electrodiagnostic study findings. The strength of thumb abduction and index finger flexion was measured in each hand three times, and the average value was used to calculate the Thumb-Index Ratio (TIR).\n\nThe TIR was evaluated in 67 patients (119 hands) with a mean age of 57.6 years (range 28 to 81). Fourteen males and 53 females were studied. The higher the preoperative nerve conduction study grade of the patients, the lower the TIR was observed (p<0.001, Analysis of Variance). TIR measurements of cases with thenar atrophy were significantly lower than those without (p<0.001, t-test). Lastly, TIR was significantly lower in patients with severe median nerve swelling in ultrasonography (p=0.042, Anova).\n\nOverall, these results suggest that measurements of median nerve motor function using a load cell can be a valuable evaluation tool in CTS, which may help detect subclinical motor dysfunction before muscle atrophy develops.", "label": "alpaca"}
{"text": "First of all, “Mexican Werewolf in Texas” is not a very appropriate title for the movie, as it is actually about a Chupacabra terrorizing a small town in Texas. The distributors most likely chose this title to bring in extra money, as it is likely that it would have been less successful if it had retained its original title. \n\n The film is absolutely terrible, and I can see why it might entice certain audiences. It is cheaply made with bad dialogue and actors that overact terribly. However, it is entertaining in a bad way - like a train wreck, you can’t help but look away from the screen. If you’re into bad movies, then it might be worth a watch. \n\n The cinematography is decent during the daytime scenes, but most of the film takes place at night, making the lighting too dark to adequately see what is happening. The gore scenes are short but extremely graphic and realistic-looking, which might be off-putting to some viewers. \n \n Overall, “Mexican Werewolf in Texas” is a bad movie that is only worthy of a watch if you’re a fan of bad movies. Otherwise, it’s not worth the time investment.", "label": "alpaca"}

The sample of 560 clusters contains eight times more clusters in the redshift interval $0.15<z<0.75$ than those used by the Planck collaboration in a similar analysis, and one order of magnitude smaller mass clusters than those used by the Planck collaboration.  We found that the Planck prediction convolved with the Planck antenna beam agrees with the anisotropies measured in the X-ray emitting region. We confirmed earlier findings that the relation of the comptonization parameter and the X-ray luminosity is consistent with Self-Similar Model predictions. We also showed that the discrepancy between prediction and measurement is not due to the presence of “cool core” systems, and is likely a result of a break in the relation towards low mass systems. Finally, we confirmed that the scaling relations studied here do not evolve with redshift within the range probed by our catalog.", "label": "alpaca"}

For those who can stomach it, however, it is a powerful and visually striking journey that showcases hard-hitting Asian hyper-violence akin to Chan-wook Park’s Vengeance trilogy. \n\nThe story follows Pang, a Cambodian hit-man who travels to Hong Kong to assassinate the wife of a judge. Alongside him on his mission is Wai, the ruthless cop determined to track him down. \n\nWith Wai closing in on his target, Pang resorts to desperate measures to ensure his escape. This involves a meeting with a beautiful illegal immigrant, Yue, whom he helps and who, in turn, helps him. \n\nHowever, it is a story of doomed love: tragic and inevitable. Although the two main characters manage to evade capture and carry out their mission, their escape is short-lived. Even before their reunion with the cop, Pang and Wai have both experienced horrific tragedies. The film crosses the final line between tragedy and comedy when, in a laughably over-dramatic final scene, Pang and Wai are locked in battle whilst a pregnant Yue looks on.\n\nEventually, after all three have suffered severe stab wounds, a wounded Pang performs a DIY Ceasarean on (a now dead) Yue, delivering their baby moments before he himself dies. \n\nWhilst this film might not be a classic, it is still worth seeking out for fans of dark and violent films.", "label": "alpaca"}

{"text": "2015-10-26 04:33, edited 2015-10-26 04:47 by Tsunemori-PASSI've been away from the game for many months now (I'll start playing again in a week or two) and was not aware of the death of IceHouse, not too much of a loss though since I was constantly being votebanned off the server and having to then get unbanned. Despite it being frustrating it was always preferable to playing on international servers, even in southern Asia where you can often expect to be getting 150ms. And their servers are hardly any better anyway and mostly consist of 64-player nade fests on Metro.Personally I'd prefer to see a 32-player rush and 32-player conquest small server with good rotations. I strongly dislike the idea of a 64-player conquest large server since the playerbase is so low I'd prefer to have 2x 32-player servers that both offer a different game mode and/or maps. Conquest small on 32-player is almost as good as 64-player conquest large anyway.Anyway Goose, it's unlikely you're going to achieve much with a forum/Reddit thread. Simply because very few players check the forums on any decent regularity. What I'd suggest is creating a platoon based around this. Getting people to join that platoon is going to give them more of a sense of purpose and community. It will allow them to see how many other people are interested in keeping this game alive and pursuing a common goal. A platoon where you propose there what you are proposing here. I believe that you'd get more attention that way.The truth is that this game (in Australia) probably would have reached this point of teetering on the brink of death a year ago if it hadn't been for a few communities/clans that sprung into existence in 2014 like MON, rAGE, ICG, RBL. Admittedly I think RBL existed long before 2014 but they were one of the communities that stuck around and continued to generate interest among their members.Having been a member of MON and rAGE, I can tell you that when I was playing 4+ hours a day every day for months it was solely because of the people I was playing with. I'd still have played even if it was just myself but I'd have put in considerably less time. Not to mention the sheer amount of servers we were instrumental in populating was incredible. If we wanted to play Damavand Peak rush (I always did) we'd get 10+ of us to jump onto an empty one and in half and hour it would be fully populated. Even the MON server would often go unpopulated until we decided to go ahead and begin populating it by ourselves first. The rest of the playerbase will often jump on board once they think the server is going to get some decent numbers.If you want to keep this game alive in Australia and avoid a divided community. if you want to be able to put your idea into action then you need to create a community like the ones above.

We also derived the Blue shift and spin splitting of the exciton luminescence lines, as well as the Boltzmann equation for excitons and estimates of the energy and spin relaxation time resulting from exciton-exciton scattering. By making use of these calculations, we were able to explain some recently observed experimental results which had not been explained before.", "label": "alpaca"}
{"text": "This literature review examines the role of positron emission tomography (PET) or PET/Computed Tomography (PET/CT) using different radiopharmaceuticals in recurrent Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma (MTC) based on biochemical findings of increased tumor marker levels after primary surgery. Twenty-nine studies comprising 714 patients with suspected recurrent MTC were retrieved from the PubMed/Medline, Scopus, and Embase databases. Twenty-seven articles evaluated the role of F18-FDG PET or PET/CT in recurrent MTC with conflicting results. Diagnostic accuracy of F18-FDG PET and PET/CT increased in MTC patients with higher calcitonin and carcinoembryonic antigen values, suggesting that these imaging methods could be very useful in patients with more advanced and aggressive disease. Eight articles evaluated the role of F18-DOPA PET or PET/CT in recurrent MTC reporting promising results. Overall, F18-DOPA seems to be superior but complementary compared to F18-FDG in detecting recurrent MTC. Few studies evaluating other PET tracers are also discussed. Conclusions: PET radiopharmaceuticals reflect different metabolic pathways in MTC. F18-DOPA seems to be the most useful PET tracer in detecting recurrent MTC based on rising levels of tumor markers, and may be complementary to F18-FDG in patients with more aggressive MTC.", "label": "alpaca"}

{"text": "Context consistency checking is challenging in dynamic, uncertain ubiquitous computing environments due to high levels of noise from unreliable sensing data streams, inaccurate data measurement, and unstable connectivity. One of the most advanced approaches to this problem is CEDA, which concurrently detects context consistency by exploring the “happened-before” relation among events. However, this method is limited by several side effects, such as a heavy checker process, complex computing requirements, and false negative.\n\nSeCA: Snapshot-Based Event Detection for Checking Asynchronous Context Consistency in Ubiquitous Computing seeks to address the shortcomings of CEDA by introducing Snapshot-Based Timestamping for checking event relations.

It describes, in story after story, how these sort of activities are able to take place. The lawlessness of the high seas is a reality due to several factors. First, many of the world's freighters are of questionable registry (nationality) which makes it difficult to enforce international laws when the ship owners don't have an office in a real country. Second, many ship lines employ crews from poorer third-world countries, who are often threatened and bullied into complying with illegal practices. Third, there is a language barrier, both between the officers and the crew, as well as between the crew members themselves. The crew are rewarded for their compliance and silence.

{"text": "2,2:6,2-ternaphthalene ( nnn ) is a novel blue-emitting material suitable for the preparation of organic light-emitting diodes. Its crystal structure has been solved recently, but its thermal behavior and surface properties have not yet been explored, partly due to the difficulty in obtaining high-quality crystals. In this study, we use classical molecular dynamics to investigate the thermal behavior of bulk and (001) surfaces of nnn. Our bulk simulations indicate the occurrence of a phase transition at about 600K. The transition is facilitated by the presence of a free (001) surface, since a reconstruction leading to a very similar structure occurs around 550K in our surface models. This holds for both ideal and defective surface models, containing a small number of vacancies (one or two missing molecules in the outermost layer). In all cases, the process is triggered by thermal motion and involves the reorientation of the molecules with respect to the (001) plane.

{"text": "The aim of this study was to evaluate whether serum titers of second-generation anticyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies (anti-CCP2) are associated with the severity and extent of interstitial lung disease in rheumatoid arthritis (RA-ILD). 39 RA-ILD patients, confirmed by high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT), were compared to 42 RA patients without lung involvement (RA only). Disease characteristics were assessed in all of the patients and serum anti-CCP2 titer quantified. \n\nHigher anti-CCP2 titers were found in RA-ILD compared to RA only (median 77.9 u/mL vs. 30.2 u/mL, p < 0.001). In the logistic regression analysis after adjustment for age, disease duration (dd), smoke exposure, disease activity, functioning, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and methotrexate (MTX) treatment duration, the characteristics associated with RA-ILD were higher anti-CCP2 titers (p = 0.003) and + rf (p = 0.002). In multivariate linear regression, the variables associated with severity of ground-glass score were anti-CCP2 titers (p = 0.02) and with fibrosis score dd (p = 0.01), anti-CCP2 titers (p < 0.001) and MTX treatment duration (p < 0.001). \n\nThese data suggest that higher anti-CCP2 titers are associated with worse prognosis in RA-ILD and may be a useful biomarker in the prediction of disease severity and extent. Further longitudinal studies are required to identify if higher anti-CCP2 titers are associated with worst prognosis in RA-ILD.", "label": "alpaca"}

Although no significant difference was found in the HBeAg seroconversion rates between the two groups at Week 24 and 48, the difference was not significant at Week 96 (p>0.05).  In addition, in Week 48 and 96, the Alt normalization rate of Group A was obviously lower than that of Group B (p<0.05).  Group A patients were also divided into Group A1 (m) and Group A2 (>m) according to the median value (m=2.79) of the baseline Homeostatic Model Assessment (HMA) Insulin Resistance levels. In Week 48 and 96, the Alt normalization rate of Group A1 was significantly higher than that of Group A2 (p<0.05). Furthermore, the correlation coefficient (r) of the Baseline HMA Insulin Resistance level and the severity of fatty liver in Group A was 0.426 (p=0.001). These findings suggested that NAFLD can affect the long-term total virologic response rate and HBeAg seroconversion rate in CHB patients treated with entecavir.

Rebecca Eastwood, Lynda Mann's sister, started a petition which gathered 19,222 supporters and was submitted to the Parole Board before the hearing. Ms Ashworth expressed concern that he may pose a danger to the public if released again and stated, \"I would far sooner he was still in prison where I consider he belongs.

The Court of Appeal reduced his minimum term to 28 years in 2009, taking into account his progress in custody, education to degree level, and lack of disciplinary issues. He has become a specialist in transcribing printed music into Braille, which is used across the UK and internationally, and has never been placed \"on report\" while in custody. The Parole Board is required to assess whether a prisoner is a danger to the public, and not consider punishment or the amount of time Pitchfork has already served.

{"text": "Since its creation, the Treaty of European Union has promoted the free movement of its citizens within the member states. This is based on the idea that people should be able to pursue their life goals regardless of their nationality. From the 1970s, this focus shifted towards creating a more socially-oriented Europe, emphasizing the rights of citizens instead of economic activity as the primary driver of the project. According to the Court of Justice, a worker is defined as anyone who is economically active, including those who volunteer services in exchange for housing and other amenities. This means that the rights enjoyed by workers under TFEU Article 45 function as a specific expression of the general rights provided to citizens in TFEU Articles 18 to 21. In Steymann vs Staatssecretaris van Justitie, a German man successfully claimed the right to stay in the Netherlands as his economic activity was performed within the Bhagwan community, which provided for everyone's material needs without expecting remuneration. This reinforces the notion that anyone who is economically active can enjoy protection against discrimination when it comes to employment, taxation, and social security rights. Despite this, the free movement of people has been met with considerable opposition from nationalist political forces, which manipulate fears about immigrants taking jobs and benefits away from locals. In practice, available research shows that there is very little impact of labour mobility on wages and employment.", "label": "alpaca"}

{"text": "A spiral galaxy partially overlapping a more distant elliptical offers a unique opportunity to measure the dust extinction in the foreground spiral from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR4 spectroscopic sample. We selected occulting galaxy pairs and measured the disk opacity over the redshift range of z=0.0-0.2 in order to determine the recent evolution of disk dust opacity.\n\nThe enrichment of the ISM changes over the lifetime of a disk and it is reasonable to expect the dust extinction properties of spiral disks as a whole to change over their lifetime. When they do, the change will affect our measurements of galaxies over the observable universe. From the SDSS pairs, we conclude that spiral disks show evidence of extinction to {math@math0}2{math@math0} effective radii. However, no evidence for recent evolution of disk opacity is evident, due to the limited redshift range and our inability to distinguish other factors on disk opacity such as the presence of spiral arms and Hubble type. Such effects also mask any relation between surface brightness and optical depth that has been found in nearby galaxies. Therefore, we conclude that the SDSS spectral catalog is an excellent way to find occulting pairs and construct a uniform local sample. However, higher resolution than the SDSS images is needed to disentangle the effects of spiral arms and Hubble type from evolution since z=0.2.", "label": "alpaca"}

Mutations of pyrin lead to uncontrolled inflammation, and subclinical inflammation continues during attack-free intervals. \n\n                        Aim of Study:\n                        The aim of this study was to look for immunogenetic determinants in the pathogenesis of FMF, and to determine if Killer Cell Immunoglobulin-Like Receptor (KIR) genes are related to susceptibility to disease or complications like renal amyloidosis.\n\n                        Methods:\n                        \n                        One hundred and five FMF patients and 100 healthy individuals were involved in the study.  Isolated DNA from peripheral blood was amplified by Sequence-Specific PCR probes and analyzed by Luminex for KIR genotypes. \n\n                        Results:\n\n                        All patients and healthy controls expressed the Framework genes.  An activator KIR gene, KIR2DS2, was significantly more frequent in FMF patients (p = 0.036).  Renal amyloidosis and presence of arthritis were not associated with KIR genes or genotype. \n\n                        Conclusion:\n                        \n                        According to our findings, we suggest that presence of KIR2DS2, which is an activator gene for NK cell functions, might be related to the autoinflammation in FMF.  The potential effect of KIR genes on amyloidosis and other clinical features requires studies with larger sample sizes.", "label": "alpaca"}
{"text": "Percentile growth curves are often used as a clinical indicator to evaluate variations in children's growth status. In this study, we proposed empirical percentile growth curves using z-scores adapted for Japanese thoroughbred horses, taking into consideration the seasonal compensatory growth that is a typical characteristic of seasonal breeding animals. We previously developed new growth curve equations for Japanese thoroughbreds adjusting for compensatory growth. Individual horses and residual effects were included as random effects in the growth curve equation model and their respective variances were estimated. Based on the z-scores of the estimated variance components, empirical percentile growth curves were constructed. A total of 5,594 and 5,680 body weight and age measurements of male and female thoroughbreds, respectively, and 3,770withers height and age measurements were used in the analysese. The developed empirical percentile growth curves using z-scores are computationally feasible and useful for monitoring individual growth parameters of body weight and withers height of young thoroughbred horses, especially during compensatory growth periods.", "label": "alpaca"}

{"text": "So, welcome to Doom - 1994! - May 18, 1994 to be exact. A time when even Doom 2 hadn't been released (I know - hard to believe). It's not that I don't have enough reviews to do, but I had this itch to do something different. I was looking through some of the old maps I had already reviewed on the site, and it came to me that I could revisit something that was turning 20 years old! This map has been around for exactly 20 years, and it's an experience that I've really enjoyed going back to.\n\n                ##Input:\n                              I must admit, it was quite challenging to go through at first. There were soldiers, imps, cacos, lost souls, demons, specters and even a cyberdemon to battle, all with varying degrees of difficulty. You would think that with all these enemies and tricky sections, the map would be frustratingly hard.

There was even a helpful tip system to help players with the tougher parts. There was even an optional red key that enabled you to access even tougher areas with even tougher enemies. All in all, it was quite an enjoyable experience and certainly much more difficult than the majority of maps of its time.\n                              ##Design:\n                              The map was excellently designed.

Some provisions could be abused or avoided, tax experts say, while others may cause unintended consequences that were not anticipated. In order to game the system, clever tax lawyers may find ways to take advantage of loopholes and exemptions that were not addressed. For instance, the proposed legislation includes a provision to exempt \"Pass Through\" businesses. It is possible that wealthy individuals and corporations will find ways to abuse this provision. Other provisions may require changes or be ineffective, like the last-minute decision to include the Alternative Minimum Tax in the bill, which was created to ensure that the wealthy pay their fair share of taxes. Tax experts are still trying to understand the detailed rules of this provision and how it will affect many businesses. In some cases, the proposals require such detailed knowledge that it leaves experts scratching their heads. For example, the bill includes a provision to start taxing the investment earnings of rich private universities’ endowments, but this is so poorly defined that even the IRS may struggle to figure out what exactly is covered. Many of these provisions require very specific and technical knowledge to understand and exploit, even for those experienced in tax law, making it difficult for the general public to take advantage of any potential loopholes.

And in January the average price paid by a first-time buyer was Â£210,000. Getting a together a deposit to match that kind of figure is often the hardest part of the process. But Newsbeat met two friends from Preston who found a new way. Oliver Wood, 21, and Adam Whybrow, 25, decided to buy a house together after a chat down the pub. \"Adam and I are friends and we realised we're in a similar place financially,\" says Oliver, who works as an engineer. \"It seemed quite sensible to split everything between us and buy a house.\" They moved back in with their parents after graduating from university and saved up a deposit while working. \"We are lucky, we've got nice parents who are willing to let us stay at home and willing to let us save up to fund a deposit to put down on a house,\" says Adam, who works as a teacher.

She hated the idea and script of this film before it was released but she made sure she kept that quiet so she could get paid for this travesty of a film. I mean come on! She acted in it for Heaven's sake! What this film was really was anti-men if anything. It portrays men as stupid animals whose brains are in their groins with the men doing stupid things to attract the attention of Uma Thurman's character Noelle. There are other bad things about this film too like Ben Chaplin's character being the British man every American girl finds cute and Jamie Foxx being the token black best friend of Chaplin and of course Foxx had to try and mimic his accent a few times for good measure. Is that the best the script writers could come up with? Blimey they've never done that before except with every Hugh Grant and Dudley Moore film ever made. There's also a truly awful phone sex scene which is just grotesque and proves how cheap the film is. The other comments on here all say how Janeane Garofalo isn't ugly but is actually beautiful. Erm was I watching the same film as they were? She's certainly no looker and the only good thing about this film was that she was rightly cast as the ugly one. Although having said that, I fail to see the appeal of Uma Thurman as well: she's lanky and gaunt looking.", "label": "alpaca"}

The story centers around a young boy named Harry Vardon, who is awoken by the cries of men outside his house. He goes to investigate and is told they are building a golf course. Instantly intrigued, I found myself drawn back in to the movie as it follows Harry's life and the influence of his upbringing on his career as a professional golfer. We also meet Francis, a young man dealing with ghosts from his past, as well as his caddy, Eddie Lowery, who serves as not only his caddy but a source of encouragement and guidance. As the movie progresses, you watch Francis use his skills as a golfer to overcome the class barrier which is so prevalent in the period.

{"text": "The aim of this study was to investigate the probable mechanism behind the volume increase of laparoscopically harvested omentum flaps used to treat breast deformities.\n\nMethods:\n\nA histological analysis of omentum samples was performed to study the volume increase of laparoscopically harvested omentum flaps. Samples were harvested immediately after the transposition of the omentum from the abdominal cavity to the breast region and during the second surgical procedure for breast symmetrization of eight patients submitted to the transposition of the omentum flap. Changes in the morphometric measurements of the adipocytes (perimeter, diameter, and area), microvascular density (measured by the CD31 endothelial marker), and immunohistochemical expression of VEGF were documented.\n\nResults:\n\nThe increases in adipocyte size and microvascular density were statistically significant (P < 0.012). The expression levels of VEGF were lower in the second set of samples when compared to the first set, but the differences were not statistically significant (P < 0.093).\n\nConclusion:\n\nThese results demonstrate an increase in cellular volume as measured by adipocyte perimeter, diameter, and area. Moreover, the increase in the number of vessels in the second set of samples suggests that neoangiogenesis was stimulated by the initial increase in VEGF expression levels observed in the first set of samples. The increase in VEGF expression in the flap may have been caused by adipocyte hypertrophy resulting from neoangiogenesis.", "label": "alpaca"}

The study included individuals aged 65 years and older who were newly diagnosed with dementia from 2006 to 2010. A total of 8,406 dementia cases and 16,812 controls were enrolled.\n\nThe results revealed that zolpidem use was significantly associated with an increased risk of dementia, with an odds ratio of 1.33 and 95% confidence interval of 1.24-1.41. Additionally, when participants were stratified by underlying diseases, such as hypertension, diabetes, and stroke, the risk of dementia was still significantly higher with zolpidem use.\n\nFurthermore, in the analysis of cumulative dose, the significant associations between zolpidem use and dementia were observed in participants with the cumulative dose between 170 and 819 mg/year (adjusted odds ratio = 1.65, 95% confidence interval = 1.08-2.51, p = 0.0199). This indicates that the higher cumulative dose of zolpidem, the higher the risk of dementia development. However, the effects of lower and higher cumulative dose of zolpidem were not significant.\n\nIn conclusion, the study suggests that zolpidem use may be associated with increased risk for dementia in elderly populations. Specifically, the higher cumulative dose of zolpidem may be associated with an even higher risk of dementia development. Additional research is needed to further explore and confirm these results.", "label": "alpaca"}
{"text": "Our previous submillimetre (submm) observations of the luminous blue variable (LBV) star, Carinae, detected a flux of @xmath0 cool dust emission. These observations were limited by the low declination of Carinae and the contamination from free-free emission originating from the stellar wind. Here, we present deep submm observations with LOBCOA at 870m, taken shortly after a maximum in the 5.5-yr radio cycle. We find a significant difference in the submm flux measured here compared to the previous observation, the first indication of variability at submm wavelengths. A comparison of the submm structures with ionized emission features suggests that the 870m is dominated by emission from the ionized wind, rather than thermal emission from dust. We estimate @xmath3 of dust surrounding Carinae. The spatial distribution of the submm emission limits the mass loss to within the last thousand years, and is associated with mass ejected during the Great Eruptions and the pre-outburst LBV wind phase; we estimate that Carinae has ejected @xmath4 of gas within this timescale.

{"text": "While research has demonstrated that spike timing is able to convey detailed information from the sensory periphery to the brain, the role of neural networks in computation is still ambiguous. Most models of computation in neural networks rely on the analysis of population firing rates. Recently, Denève and colleagues suggested that neurons' spiking behavior may be essential to how neuronal networks compute. Their proposal postulates that neurons fire to reduce the error in the network's output. This enabled the demonstration of linear computations carried out by networks of integrate-and-fire neurons that interact through instantaneous synapses. This framework still leaves open the possibility that realistic networks, with conductance-based neurons, subthreshold nonlinearity, and the slower timescales of biophysical synapses, may not fit into this framework. Here, we extend the spike-based approach to these networks and demonstrate that our model networks produce irregular, poisson-like spike times and maintain a tight balance of excitation and inhibition. Lastly, we discuss how the behavior of our model scales with network size or the number of neurons recorded from a larger computing network. These results significantly increase the biological plausibility of the spike-based approach to network computation.", "label": "alpaca"}

{"text": "We consider a system of parallel straight edge dislocations and analyze its asymptotic behavior in the limit of many dislocations. The dislocations are represented by points in a plane and they are arranged in vertical walls. Each wall is free to move in the horizontal direction and the energy contains contributions from repulsive pairwise interactions between all walls, a global shear stress forcing the walls to the left, and a pinned wall at xmath2 that prevents the walls from leaving through the left boundary. \n                  We study the behavior of the energy as the number xmath1 of walls tends to infinity and characterize this behavior in terms of xmath3-convergence. There are five different cases, depending on the asymptotic behavior of the single dimensionless parameter xmath4, corresponding to xmath5, xmath6, and xmath7, and the two critical regimes xmath8 and xmath9. As a consequence, we obtain characterizations of the limiting behavior of stationary states in each of these five regimes. The results shed new light on the open problem of upscaling large numbers of dislocations.  We show how various existing upscaled models arise as special cases of the theorems of this paper. The wide variety of behavior suggests that upscaled models should incorporate more information than just dislocation densities. This additional information is encoded in the limit of the dimensionless parameter xmath4.", "label": "alpaca"}

{"text": "Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) is a major cause of urinary tract infections (UTIs), including cystitis and pyelonephritis, as well as serious complications such as acute renal failure. UPEC expresses a multitude of virulence factors to breach the mucosal barrier and allow invasion of the normally sterile urinary tract. This leads to host inflammatory responses and the exfoliation of infected bladder epithelial cells. Recent studies have shed light on how UPEC virulence factors interact with calcium-dependent signaling pathways to activate the innate host response. Despite numerous host defense mechanisms, UPEC can persist within the urinary tract and be a source of recurrent infections and serious complications. Understanding the molecular details of these events is essential for development of successful strategies for preventing UTIs and their related complications.", "label": "alpaca"}

{"text": "We have discovered that the free-floating planetary mass object OTS44, with a mass of around 9.5 Jupiter masses, shows significant accretion and a substantial disk. This confirms that the processes characterizing the \"star-like\" mode of formation also apply to isolated objects down to a few Jupiter masses. We have also detected strong, broad, and variable Paschen $\\alpha$ emission from the object, the first evidence for active accretion of a free-floating planet. OTS44 serves as a free-floating analog of accreting planets that orbit stars, allowing us to study accretion and disk physics at the extreme. Furthermore, our analysis shows that the mass accretion rate decreases continuously from stars of several solar masses down to free-floating planets. We have also determined the disk mass and further disk properties of OTS44 via modeling its SED including Herschel far-IR data. We find that objects between 14 and 0.01 solar masses have the same ratio of the disk-to-central-mass of about 1 percent, suggesting that OTS44 is formed like a star and that the increasing number of young free-floating planets and ultra-cool T and Y dwarfs are the low-mass extension of the stellar population.", "label": "alpaca"}

{"text": "Using the latest Chandra observation data of the galactic supernova remnant Cassiopeia A taken in December 2007, combined with previous archival Chandra observations taken in 2000, 2002 and 2004, we were able to estimate the remnant's forward shock velocity at various points around its outermost shell to range between 4200 and 5200 km/s. These results, when combined with previous analyses of Cassiopeia A's X-ray emission, allowed us to create a model for the evolution of the remnant and to find that its expansion is well fit by an ejecta profile running into a circumstellar wind. We further found that while the position of the reverse shock in this model is consistent with that measured in the X-rays, in order to match the forward shock velocity and radius we had to assume that 30% of the explosion energy was used to accelerate cosmic rays at the forward shock. The new X-ray images also showed brightness variations for some forward shock filaments, like the one seen for several non-thermal filaments seen projected within the interior of the remnant, and spectral fits to exterior forward shock filaments and interior non-thermal filaments showed that they exhibit similar spectra. This, together with similar flux variations, suggests that interior non-thermal filaments might be simply forward shock filaments seen in projection and not located at the reverse shock as recently proposed.", "label": "alpaca"}

{"text": "People watch movies for a variety of reasons; some seek the escapism of fantastical worlds, while others prefer the excitement of thrilling action. This movie provides something different: a glimpse into the realities of life. There is no extravagant budget, no special effects, no car chases, and no explosions. Instead, it presents a raw look into the everyday struggles of its characters, none of whom are perfect and all of whom must learn to explore, accept, and make order out of the chaos of their lives. I will not limit the potential of parapsychology since I am not an expert or use the full extent of my brain.\n\nSo watch this movie for the characters alone - it is full of wonderful, unique, and quirky individuals. Within the first few minutes, Kiefer Sutherland superbly enacts Detective Michael Hayden's life, and his performance continues to develop the character as the movie progresses. Excellent acting and believable rapport between his 'Harvey' and Kiefer's 'Mickey' enhance the oppositeness of their characters, with the cranky landlady, 'Mrs Ramsay', providing a necessary comic relief. There is more to these characters and all their flaws, as well as the beauty of their moments of grace, that I cannot express in words, so watch the movie and enjoy getting to know them.", "label": "alpaca"}

In addition to that, I've added some important upgrades that you could purchase in order to perform even better.\n                    Those additions are by no means mandatory but could give you a little push to realize the dreamy climb to Cosmic Rank.\n                        Training/experience is key and not giving up after a few losses is also important. Biggest advice I can give is instead of complaining about losses, to use it as a learning opportunity and analyze what happened because there's a good chance you could have played more optimally. This is especially true at the beginning of your learning curve and please don't forget that the decks are actually hard to pilot. \n                    General Tips For Playing Aggro \n                    Since most decks on this list are aggro, some general tips for playing this playstyle will probably be useful for those taking their first steps into constructed. \n                    Be sure to attack the most efficient way possible, especially once you are playing high ranked opposition.

Human antimicrobial peptides, -defensins (human neutrophil peptides, hnps), human -defensins (hbds), and cathelicidin (ll-37) not only display potent bactericidal activities against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, yet also function as immunomodulatory molecules by inducing cytokine and chemokine production, and inflammatory and immune cell activation. Neutrophils are a critical effector cell in host defense against microbial infection, and their lifespan is regulated by various pathogen- and host-derived substances. Here, we demonstrated that hnp-1, hbd-3, and ll-37 can not only destroy bacteria but also powerfully modulate (suppress) neutrophil apoptosis, accompanied with the phosphorylation of erk-1/2, the downregulation of tbid (an proapoptotic protein), and upregulation of bcl-xl (an antiapoptotic protein), and the inhibition of mitochondrial membrane potential change and caspase 3 activity, possibly via the actions on the distinct receptors, the p2y6 nucleotide receptor, the chemokine receptor ccr6, and the low-affinity formyl-peptide receptor FPRl1/the nucleotide receptor p2x7, respectively.

{"text": "The earth's magnetic field is generated by dynamo processes in its electrically conducting, liquid outer core, which is governed by the term \"geodynamo\". In recent years, great effort has been put into numerical simulations of core dynamics following the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations. However, these simulations are far from Earth's core in terms of several control parameters. Different scaling analyses have revealed simple scaling laws for quantities such as heat transport, flow velocity, magnetic field strength and magnetic dissipation time. \n\nUsing an extensive dataset of 116 numerical dynamo models compiled by Christensen and colleagues, we apply a rigorous model selection method--leave-one-out cross-validation--to assess these scalings from a predictive ability perspective. We find that diffusive processes are not negligible for the flow velocity and magnetic field strength in the numerical dynamos, and that the scaling of the magnetic dissipation time is more complex than previously suggested. \nAssuming that the processes relevant in the numerical models are the same as in Earth's core, we use this scaling to estimate an ohmic dissipation of 3–8 × 10²² Watts for the core. This appears to be consistent with recent high CMB heat flux scenarios.", "label": "alpaca"}

{"text": "The 25a system contributes to the antiviral effect of interferons by synthesizing and activating ribonuclease L (RNase L). RNase L degrades both viral and cellular RNA after activation by special oligoadenylates (25a and (p)pp5a2)n, where n is a number. Both the 25a system and apoptosis serve as viral defense mechanisms, as RNase L is involved in both processes. To investigate the potential role of RNase L in apoptosis, we overexpressed human RNase L in NIH3T3 fibroblasts and found that it decreased cell viability and triggered apoptosis. Similarly, when endogenous RNase L was activated by 25a or by double-stranded RNA, it induced apoptosis. Inhibiting RNase L with a dominant-negative mutant suppressed poliovirus-induced apoptosis in interferon-primed fibroblasts. These results demonstrate that RNase L is necessary for the antiviral activity of the 25a system. \n \nAdditionally, we found that increased RNase L levels induced apoptosis, and inhibition of RNase L blocked viral-induced apoptosis. Together, our results suggest that the 25a system contributes to viral defense against RNA viruses by inducing RNase L-mediated apoptosis.", "label": "alpaca"}

{"text": "Back in 1982, a little film called Making Love shocked audiences with its open and honest portrayal of a romantic tale between two men. For years, I had been waiting for a similar story, and Latter Days did not disappoint. \n                        The movie is old-fashioned, melodramatic, and full of clichés, yet it remains utterly charming. It's the perfect combination of fantasy and reality, with a dash of religion thrown in for good measure. \n                        Yes, Mormons may reject their gay members, but Latter Days reminds us that such rejection is not limited to the Mormon church. In the movie, gay people in every religion face harsh judgment and rejection. \n                        While many might argue that great love stories are a rarity, Latter Days is an unforgettable. Its mixture of fantasy and reality grounds the story in the every day lives of the characters, making it all the more heart-warming.\n\n                        I give it more than 10 stars if I could!", "label": "alpaca"}

N’Zonzi fired in a powerful shot from outside the area that gave Jan Oblak absolutely no chance, giving Sevilla the three points and moving them up to second in the table.  Atlético had their chances, too, particularly in the second half when Vitolo and Griezmann both went close, but it wasn’t to be for Diego Simeone’s men. Koke’s second yellow for a bad foul in the 85th minute meant that Atlético were down to 10 men, and it was to be Sevilla’s day.

The narrator is an attorney who is also a divorced parent, returning home only in time for the end of the day to give her three-year-old son a goodnight kiss. Despite leaving her son in the care of his current nanny for seven months, something prompts the narrator to break the traditional length of employment. Through the juxtaposition of these two stories, Liu and Cypess offer readers insight into the uniqueness of books and the vast range of the human experience - from the mundane to the extraordinary.", "label": "alpaca"}

Flow cytometry was used to analyze the distribution of CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, Th17, Th1, and B cells in 52 pSS patients and 28 healthy controls. We discovered reduced absolute counts of CD3+ T cells in pSS patients. Analysis of CD4+ T cells showed significant proportion and absolute count differences in pSS patient's blood with autoantibodies (Abs) in comparison to controls. No significant differences were observed when investigating CD4+ and CD8+ Treg subpopulations. Similarly, the proportion and absolute counts of Th17 cells were significantly lower in pSS patient's blood. Moreover, absolute counts of CD8+ T cells were significantly lower in pSS patients in comparison to controls, and also impaired proportion and absolute counts of CD8+ subpopulations according to CD27+ and CD57+ were observed. Additionally, absolute counts of NK and Nkt cells were decreased in pSS with Abs. Interestingly, B cells proportion was increased only in blood of pSS with Abs. Our findings suggest that lymphocyte population impairment in pSS patients may be due to genetically determined lymphopenia or lymphocyte migration from the periphery to inflammatory sites or/and increased susceptibility to apoptosis.", "label": "alpaca"}
{"text": "This study looks at the fertility rates of adolescents in sub-Saharan Africa compared to elsewhere in the world, and focuses on two informal settlements in Nairobi, Kenya. Data from 897 female adolescents aged 15-19 is analysed to examine childbearing patterns and determinants.\n\n15% of these adolescents had already given birth. The findings show that marriage, being out of school and having negative influences in the peer, family and school contexts are associated with early childbearing. For adolescents aged 18-19 years, school attendance considerably delays entry into motherhood. Higher levels of social control due to parental monitoring or the perceived peer orientation to prosocial behaviours and higher religiosity decreases the likelihood of childbearing. Programmes aiming to reduce risky sexual behaviours should be introduced early and prior to the onset of sexual activity. Addressing risky factors and reinforcing protective ones could improve adolescents’ sexual and reproductive health outcomes in Nairobi slum settlements.", "label": "alpaca"}

{"text": "Measles is a highly contagious illness that impairs the ability of the body to fight infections by temporarily suppressing the immune system. This is due to the virus that causes measles, called morbillivirus, which targets cells in the immune system and uses their signaling lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAM) as a receptor. In addition, the virus can also use a ubiquitously expressed complement regulatory protein, CD46, as a receptor. However, recent studies have shown that this isn't the only receptor used by wild-type (WT) measles virus strains. Studies have shown that these strains can enter both immune and epithelial cells using distinct receptor binding sites in their hemagglutinin (H) protein. A clear answer was provided by the identification of an epithelial measles receptor, nectin4, expressed at adherens junctions. It is now known that measles specifically targets two cell types, immune cells and epithelial cells, using SLAM and nectin4, respectively. Interestingly, measles loses the ability to use either SLAM or nectin4 when it possesses specific mutations in the H protein. Despite this, the virus can still infect SLAM-positive immune cells efficiently (SLAM-tropic) and conversely can infect nectin4-positive epithelial cells efficiently (nectin4-tropic).\n\n                Understanding the physiological functions of these two receptors would provide deep insights into measles pathogenesis.  \n                \n               \n                2.5.

{"text": "This paper presents a new model of the North Polar Coronal Hole ( NPCH ) to study the dissipation and propagation of MHD waves. We investigate the effects of both isotropic viscosity and heat conduction on the propagation characteristics of NPCH. We first model NPCH by considering the differences in radial and direction perpendicular to the line of sight (LOS) in temperature, particle number density and non-thermal velocities between plumes and interplume lanes for the specific case of ions. This model includes parallel and perpendicular (to the magnetic field) heat conduction and viscous dissipation. Next, we derive the dispersion relations for the MHD waves in the case of absence and presence of parallel heat conduction. In the case of absence of parallel heat conduction, we find that MHD wave dissipation strongly depends on the viscosity for Modified Acoustic and Alfven waves. The energy flux density of Acoustic waves varies between Math0 and Math1 while the energy flux density of Alfven waves turned out to be between Math2. Solutions of the magnetoacoustic waves show that the parallel heat conduction introduce anomalous dispersion to the NPCH plasma wherein the group velocity of waves exceeds the speed of light in vacuum. Our results suggests all these waves may provide significant source for the observed preferential accelerating and heating of ions, in turn coronal plasma heating and an extra accelerating agent for fast solar wind in NPCH.", "label": "alpaca"}

The QT interval and QT dispersion (QTD) were assessed.\n\nResults showed that the QT interval and QTD were significantly decreased in the patients after recovery (p<0.01). \n\nProcedures:\n- Sixteen patients had prolonged QT intervals (range: 45-381 ms) during DKA that decreased to one patient after recovery, whose QT interval (45 ms) returned to normal 5 days after hospital discharge.\n- Nineteen patients had prolonged QTD (>50 ms) during DKA that decreased to three after recovery.\n- Anion gap was significantly associated with QT and QTD prolongation (p<0.0001).\n- No electrolyte abnormalities or hypoglycemia were found to account for QT or QTD prolongation. \n\nConclusion:\nProlonged QT and QTD frequently occur in DKA and are positively correlated with ketosis. Cardiac monitoring for patients with DKA is thus mandatory.", "label": "alpaca"}

We express the Fourier transform of the joint probability density of the process to attain given values at multiple different times and to attain a given maximal value in a given time period through Fourier transforms of the jump intensity. Then, we consider a portfolio of stocks and options on stocks and derive the Fourier transform of a random variable xmath1 (deviation of the portfolio) that is defined as a small temporal change of the portfolio diminished by the compound interest earned. We derive a functional equation for the price of the option on the stock as a function of the stock, subject to the condition that the deviation of the portfolio has a zero mean xmath2 = 0$.

{"text": "Central venous catheters (CVCS) are commonly used in intensive care units, and bloodstream infections remain a leading cause of healthcare-associated infections, particularly among preterm infants. The survival rate of extremely-low-birth-weight infants can be partly attributed to the routine practice of CVC placement. The most common types of CVCs used in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) include umbilical venous catheters, peripherally inserted central catheters, and tunneled catheters. \n\nBloodstream infections (BSIs) are caused by pathogens such as gram-positive cocci, coagulase-negative staphylococci, and sometimes gram-negative organisms. Risk factors for BSIs include prolonged catheter placement, femoral access, low birth weight, and young gestational age. NICUs have strategies for catheter insertion and maintenance to decrease infection rates, including the application of strict protocols for hand hygiene and appropriate skin care for the infant. \n\nIn conclusion, infection rates can be reduced by adhering to protocols for CVC insertion and maintenance, as well as educating NICU physicians and nurses on the best practices for preventing infections.", "label": "alpaca"}

This is due to the fact that as the poor become wealthier, their yearly carbon emissions increase. This phenomenon is known as the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC). Although with greater economic inequality comes more waste and pollution, this can be offset by better waste management. When inequality is lower, the resources and funds available to treat waste and pollution is greater, meaning that the overall impact on the environment is reduced. Furthermore, a lower population would mean that the amount of resources and funds available to treat waste and pollution increases even more.

Thus far, the benches had remained empty, but as the 4th inning concluded, the tension between the two teams had ramped up significantly.The 5th inning arrived, and with it, Perez came up to bat yet again. This time, both teams’ benches filled with players, and a full-fledged brawl ensued. Greg Booker and Ozzie Virgil of the Padres, and the three Braves that had been tossed earlier, all took part in what one fan described as “an old-fashioned dirt-kicking, fist-swinging, bench-clearing donnybrook”. Despite this second altercation, the Padres hadn’t retaliated, and so the fight ended with them down 2 players, still down 3 runs, and having failed twice to hit Perez.However, the Padres wouldn’t be denied in the 6th inning. This time, Craig Lefferts tried his luck at beaning Perez, but to no avail; Perez yet again managed to slip away unscathed. This time, the Padres did respond in kind, as they tried to retaliate by throwing bags of dirt and peanuts at the Braves’ bench. Nevertheless, the Braves eventually emerged victorious, winning the game 4-3 despite the heated tensions.Suffice to say, the game between the Padres and Braves in 1987 was a wild one, filled with bench clearings, beanballs, and peanuts. Ultimately, the Braves won, but had to endure two failed attempts to plunk the same batter, Pascual Perez, in two successive innings. The Padres, on the other hand, were left with two ejected players, two failed attempts to hit Perez, and a losing record.", "label": "alpaca"}

{"text": "The evaluation of health is one of the major challenges of today's research, and many factors such as culture, structure, and values can have an influence on the health of an individual or of a society. Various indicators including well-being are used to measure health, and it has been confirmed that many factors such as family function can have an effect on the quality of life and well-being of family members.\n\nOne of the effective factors on these indicators is family function. Thus, family function can be considered as a social determinant of health, which can help improve the well-being of families as a part of the community.\n\nThe data collecting tools comprised of Bloom's Family Function questionnaire and Well-Being questionnaire, whose validity and reliability have already been confirmed. This study was a cross-sectional, descriptive, and analytical study carried out on 300 subjects in Isfahan in 2011. \n\nThe mean age of the sample was 45 (4.3) years, the mean of Well-Being was 23.6, and the mean of Family Function was 183.6, as measured through Anova. The findings showed that Family Function had a direct and indirect effect on the quality of life and well-being, while no significant difference was observed.Conclusions: Family Function has a direct and indirect effect on quality of life and well-being, suggesting that it should be considered as an important social determinant of health. Therefore, it may help to improve the well-being of families as a part of the community.", "label": "alpaca"}

The law, proposed by the conservative Law and Justice Party (PiS) and approved by the government, carries a potential jail sentence of up to three years. The statement issued by the Polish Justice Ministry clarifies that the law is intended to combat \"lies detrimental to the good image and good name of Poland\" which are mainly spread by foreign media. \n\nThe Nazi death camps in Poland played a significant role in the Holocaust, in which millions of Jewish people were systematically executed. Polish citizens were also implicated in war crimes against Jewish people, as well as other atrocities against non-Jewish civilians. Prior to the Nazi invasion, some Polish villagers participated in anti-Semitic violence, and following the war, some military and civilian leaders were accused of collaboration with the Germans. Despite this, the PiS government is adamant that the new law is not designed to suppress criticism of the Polish government, but to protect the nation's reputation.\n\nThis law is a highly controversial move which has been criticized by human rights organizations and some European Union members.

In his own words, \"I won't be mistaken for that.\" Furthermore, he questions whether a deeper conversation could possibly solve the problem, while also noting that every individual should be seen as more than just their beliefs and actions. Duke draws on games theory, quoting Slovenian philosopher Slavoj Žižek to prove the merits of anarchism, and logically concludes that a better understanding of each other is necessary to eventually overcome this issue. In conversation, Duke juxtaposes his left-wing political beliefs with his expertise in computer security, reasoning that the best way to find success within this sphere is to utilize hyperlogical thought processes and strategize like one would within a game. He references games theory, analyzing the situation based on the available data and concluding that he still hasn't been shot in the heart, suggesting that he's doing well. Mark and Elizabeth Hokoana are also part of this story, being labeled as the couple who turned themselves in to authorities. It was assumed that Mark was the shooter based on his Facebook messages to Yiannopoulos and his pro-Trump \"#MAGA hat\" reference the day of the shooting. However, this week, an attorney for his wife, Elizabeth Hokoana, claimed she was the shooter, asserting that she acted in defense of her husband. This claim has received some traction in the media.

{"text": "background: Differences in the quantity and distribution of coronary veins between patients with ischemic and non-ischemic cardiomyopathy might affect the potential for left ventricular (LV) lead targeting in patients undergoing cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). In this study, we assessed and compared the suitability of the coronary venous system for LV lead placement in ischemic and dilated cardiomyopathy.\n\n  methods: This single-center study, performed at our hospital, retrospectively studied 173 patients with the New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III-IV heart failure. Patients with ischemic and non-ischemic cardiomyopathy were included. The study population was composed of 74 patients with an ischemic underlying etiology and 99 patients with a non-ischemic etiology. The position of the available suitable vein and the final lead positions were recorded.\n\n  results: There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of the position of the available suitable vein, with the exception of the posterior position, where the ischemic group had slightly more suitable veins than did the dilated group (48.4% vs 32.1%, p = 0.049). There was also no significant difference with respect to the final vein, through which the LV lead was inserted. Comparative analysis showed that the patients with previous coronary artery bypass grafting surgery (CABG) had significantly fewer suitable veins in the postero lateral position than did the non-CABG group (16.3% vs 38.7%, p = 0.029). There was, however, no significant difference between the two subgroups regarding the final vein position in which the leads were inserted.\n\n  conclusion: The final coronary vein position suitable and selected for the LV lead insertion was not different between the cases with cardiomyopathy with different etiologies, and nor was it different between the ischemic cases with and without a history of CABG. Patients with a history of procedures around the coronary vessel may have an intact or recovered venous system and may, therefore, benefit from transvenous LV lead placement for CRT.", "label": "alpaca"}
{"text": "Release: Q4, 2000 - Genre: Sports, duh - Console: PS1, PS2, DC, N64, GBC Now here's a game that I can't imagine too many people own on purpose... and yet, here I am with a copy to review. \n                        Basically, what you have here is a collection of simple minigames themed around Olympic sports. You can play the games with up to three other players (multitap required, even though most games have you taking turns anyway) or alone and compete for high scores, either one at a time in trial mode, or all in a row with championship mode. \n                        That's the entirety of the game and it offers literally minutes of fun, trust me. But before we get into the details of each game, I would like to say that this game did impress me in two ways (and only two ways).  Firstly, the character animations are actually impressively good for the time this was made. Apparently they were motion captured, if the back of the box is to be believed. Second, there are really smooth text introductions to each event which are animated according to the sport; for example, 100m Hurdles has the words jumping over each other... so that's cute, I guess. \n                        In general though, the gameplay is simple, boring, and sometimes unclear. Worse, unlike real sports or other sports games, each minigame offers little room for improvement after you've mastered it, which will only take a couple of attempts. \n                        Honestly, I could probably just end the review here, but I'm sure you'd all like to see how these minigames are, so... \n                    \n                        100m DashTake a wild guess how this one is played. If you guessed \"mashing buttons\", you're right! In fact, seven of the ten events primarily consist of mashing X and O in alternation (which is awkward to do without re-positioning your hand to press them with two fingers). Oh yeah, also, all the starting text in this game looks like it's the same font (Impact) as the typical internet meme pic. \n                        100m HurdlesYep, it's the same thing as the 100m dash, except now you have to press L1 at the right time to jump over hurdles. If you were using two hands to mash buttons on the last challenge, you're going to be screwed when it comes to this one because you won't be able to reach the L1 button. Good luck with that. Long JumpOnce again, you have to mash to run and press L1 to jump at the right time. But in this one, you have to hold L1, then release it with good timing to determine the angle of your jump. Somehow, despite the simplicity, it manages to feel awkward at the same time. Pole VaultDon't be deceived! The HUD may look different, but this is essentially the exact same game as Long Jump. But now, instead of jumping with L1, you... do some unclear pole flex with it. It doesn't really matter though, since all you need to watch is the bar on the side of the screen. Oh yeah, you can also set the height you want", "label": "alpaca"}

{"text": "Macropathogens like multicellular helminths are masters of immunoregulation due to their ability to evade host defense and establish chronic infections. After an encounter between the host and the parasite, a molecular crosstalk starts between them that influences the development and progress of both the innate and adaptive arms of the immune response. Helminths can modulate the function of dendritic cells and induce immunosuppression through a regulatory network involving regulatory T cells, regulatory B cells, and alternatively activated macrophages. This way, helminths suppress and control both parasite-specific and unrelated immunopathology in the host, such as Th1-mediated autoimmune and Th2-mediated allergic diseases. However, certain helminths favor the development or exacerbation of allergic responses. In this paper, the cell types that play an essential role in helminth-induced immunoregulation, the consequences for inflammatory diseases, and the contrasting effects of Toxocara and Trichinella infection on allergic manifestations are discussed.", "label": "alpaca"}

Both total covering and single partial covering models fail to acceptably fit the observed absorption, and double partial covering or partial covering plus warm absorption appears to be required. The double partial covering model provides the best statistical fit to the data, and we measure large column densities of [Fe III] (320) and [Fe II] (258) irrespective of the particular spectral model under consideration. These X-ray columns are over an order of magnitude larger than expected based on observations at longer wavelengths. Our data suggest that most of the X-ray absorption occurs either in gas that has a relatively small amount of dust or in gas that is located within the broad line region. The X-ray absorber may well be the putative ‘atmosphere’ above the torus that collimates the ionization cone. We also detect an apparently broad 6.4 keV iron K line, and we present optical spectra demonstrating that the optical emission lines were in a representative state during our observation.", "label": "alpaca"}
{"text": "A 22-year-old man who nearly murdered his ex-girlfriend by stabbing her 32 times outside her Clearwater home, was sentenced to life in prison without parole on Monday. Nearly two years ago, Melissa Dohme had been stabbed by Robert Burton Jr. Afterward, doctors testified that her life had been saved by emergency personnel and a trauma surgeon, who had worked diligently to diminish the severity of her injuries. During this time, Dohme was left alone in the dirt, helpless, as Burton drove away. Miraculously, she survived this near-fatal tragedy, and went on to undergo further surgery and therapy, while Burton was eventually apprehended after crashing his truck in Pasco County following an overdose on sleeping pills.Dohme appeared before the judge, her emergence and subsequent journey inspiring the nation as she testified of her attack. Despite Burton’s parent’s pleads for mercy, citing that it was an “aberration”, the judge concluded that Burton had committed a grave and heinous crime, thereby ensuring that he would never be able to commit such an atrocity again.", "label": "alpaca"}

{"text": "1720 MHz masers are excellent signposts of interaction between supernova remnants (SNRs) and molecular clouds. By using the GBT and VLA, we surveyed 75 SNRs and 6 candidates for masers. Four SNRs are detected with OH masers: G5.4 - 1.2, G5.7 - 0.0, G8.7 - 0.1 and G9.7 - 0.0. Two SNRs, G5.7 - 0.0 and G8.7 - 0.1, have TeV  $\\gamma$-ray counterparts which may indicate a local cosmic ray enhancement. Additionally, maser-emitting SNRs are preferentially distributed in the molecular ring and nuclear disk. We use the present and existing surveys to demonstrate that masers are strongly confined to within 50 at a rate of 15% of the total SNR population. All new detections are within 10 galactic longitude and this trend is emphasized. Furthermore, a substantial number of SNR masers have peak fluxes at or below the detection threshold of existing surveys. This calls into question whether maser surveys of galactic SNRs can be considered complete and how many maser-emitting remnants remain to be detected in the galaxy.", "label": "alpaca"}
{"text": "It is not the spirit of the law that companies should be more careful about their reputation, warned former Chancellor George Osborne. Many firms have reduced overtime pay and perks to fund the rise in basic pay rates, while the National Living Wage (NLW) has come into effect. Mr Osborne's warning comes after a debate in the House of Commons on Monday about the impact of the 50p hourly increase in the NLW. A motion warning that the wage changes have left thousands of low-paid workers \"significantly worse off\" and calling on the government to ensure they are protected was passed unopposed. DIY chain B&Q, supermarket Tesco, coffee chain Caffe Nero and the John Lewis Partnership have all recently reduced staff payments or perks, but most have said the moves were unrelated to the 50p-an-hour increase in the NLW. B&Q initially said it planned to cut Sunday and Bank holiday pay rates in exchange for lifting the lowest hourly rate for all staff to £7.66, 46p-an-hour above the NLW. It later decided to extend compensation for workers who were adversely affected by this change to two years, from one. In April, Caffe Nero said it would no longer give its staff a free lunch when they are on shift, as part of a \"pay review\" introduced in response to the new NLW. The John Lewis Partnership - which includes supermarket chain Waitrose - said it stopped so-called premium payments - higher hourly rates for overtime or Sunday working - from 1 February after realising competitors did not offer the same deal. She said the decision was announced in September last year, before the NLW was announced, and was unrelated. She also said the group's average hourly pay rate, outside London, was above the NLW at £7.80. Similarly, Tesco said from 3 July all staff who worked on Sundays and Bank holidays would be paid at time-and-a-half, rather than the current double time rate received by staff on older contracts. It also said staff negatively affected would receive a lump sum covering 18 months of the pay difference. The OBR has warned that 60,000 jobs will be lost by 2020 as a direct result of the NLW.\n                #Output #English", "label": "alpaca"}
{"text": "The next generation of cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments, galaxy surveys, and high-redshift observations could potentially determine the nature of the dark matter observationally. With this in mind, we introduce a phenomenological model for a Generalized Dark Matter (GDM) component and discuss its effect on large-scale structure and CMB anisotropies. Specifying the gravitational influence of the otherwise non-interacting GDM requires not merely a model for its equation of state but one for its full stress tensor. From consideration of symmetries, conservation laws, and gauge invariance, we construct a simple but powerful three-component parameterization of these stresses that exposes the new phenomena produced by GDM. Limiting cases include a particle component (e.g. WIMPS, radiation or massive neutrinos), a cosmological constant, and a scalar field component. Intermediate cases illustrate how the clustering properties of the dark matter can be specified independently of its equation of state. This freedom allows one to alter the amplitude and features in the matter power spectrum relative to those of the CMB anisotropies while leaving the background cosmology fixed. Observational constraints on such phenomena can help determine the nature of the dark matter.", "label": "alpaca"}
{"text": "Recent cases of algorithmic bias in data-driven decision-making have put machine learning methods under the microscope. In particular, basic algorithmic tasks such as subsampling from a large data set have come under scrutiny. Subsamples are used both as an endpoint in data summarization (where fairness could be a legal, political or moral requirement) and as an input to train algorithms (where biases in the samples are often a source of bias in the resulting model).\n\n                 To ensure fairness in this process, there is a growing effort to modify either the subsampling methods or the algorithms themselves. However, this raises the question of whether it is possible to produce fair subsamples that are also adequately representative of the feature space of the data set - a classic requirement in machine learning.\n\n                We first note that, in some applications, guaranteeing one does not necessarily guarantee the other. Consequently, a new approach is required. We present an algorithmic framework which allows us to produce both fair and diverse samples. Our experimental results on an image summarization task show marked improvements in fairness without compromising feature diversity, giving us the best of both worlds.", "label": "alpaca"}

It lasted from early 2372 to mid-2373, devastating the Cardassian state and greatly contributing to its eventual absorption into the Dominion. Reports of a popular uprising on Cardassia Prime, coupled with the collapse of the Obsidian Order following the disastrous Battle of the Omarion Nebula, enabled the dissident movement to overthrow the Central Command and install the Detapa Council. On Qo'noS, the news was received in a different light; Gowron and the Klingon High Council became suspicious that the revolt was instigated by the Dominion, and Martok called for a massive invasion of Cardassian space to put down the \"Changeling threat\". The resulting invasion involved a third of the Klingon Empire's standing forces, with over a hundred ships in the first wave, and proceeded according to plan. Sisko, aware of the potential for genocide, ordered Worf to uncover the Klingons' true intentions, and when Martok refused to call off the attack despite the Federation's warning, Sisko had no choice but to inform him the Federation would not support an unprovoked attack.

{"text": "An important challenge in simulating biomolecular systems is describing the protonation and deprotonation process of amino acid residues. Although this seems like a simple task of adding or removing a positively charged hydrogen nucleus, simulating the actual protonation/deprotonation process is inherently difficult. It requires both the explicit treatment of the excess proton, including its charge defect delocalization and Grothuss shuttling through inhomogeneous moieties (water and amino residues), as well as extensive sampling of coupled condensed phase motions.\n\nIn a recent paper (J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2014, 10, 2729-2737), a multiscale approach was developed to map high- level quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) data into a multiscale reactive molecular dynamics (MS-RMD) model in order to describe amino acid deprotonation in bulk water. In this article, we extend the fitting approach (called fitRMD) to create MS-RMD models for ionizable amino acids within proteins. The resulting models are shown to faithfully reproduce the free energy profiles of the reference QM/MM Hamiltonian for pT inside an example protein, the ClC-EC1 H+/Cl antiporter. Moreover, we show that the resulting MS-RMD models are computationally efficient enough to then characterize more complex 2-dimensional free energy surfaces due to slow degrees of freedom such as water hydration of internal protein cavities that can be inherently coupled to the excess proton charge translocation. The fitRMD method is thus shown to be an effective way to map ab initio level accuracy into a much more computationally efficient reactive MD model in order to simulate and quantitatively describe amino acid protonation/deprotonation in proteins.", "label": "alpaca"}

Ted Smith made a number of important saves for the Robins, while the home side had Jason Demetriou to thank for a late equalizer that denied the visitors all three points. The point means the Shrimpers remain fourth in the table, just three points off the automatic promotion places, while Swindon remain ninth, five points off the play-offs. The game began with both sides cancelling each other out, with neither creating a clear-cut opportunity in the opening period. That changed in the 27th minute when, from a corner, Anthony Wordsworth got on the end of the ball in the Swindon area and his powerful header was handled by Smith and then went narrowly wide of the post. It was a let off for the Shrimpers, who should have taken the lead two minutes later when John Obika was left unmarked at the back post, but he could only head the ball straight at Smith. Southend continued to pile on the pressure but the Swindon keeper was equal to everything that came his way and he was also called into action again in the 78th minute when Will Atkinson fired a shot from the right side of the area that he pushed away.

{"text": "This paper investigates the prevalence of corporate taxes in general equilibrium models and open economies. We observe that the major drivers of the results originate from open economies. We compare estimates from four major studies that have examined corporate tax incidence in an open economy, and adjust them to reflect central empirical estimates of key elasticities. Our findings suggest that capital bears the bulk of the corporate tax burden. Furthermore, we identify drawbacks to the use of these models, such as the focus on the long-run in contrast to the adjustment from the short-run which can be very long. We also propose an alternative method for distributing the corporate tax burden, which distinguishes between global and excise effects among nations. According to this method, capital bears the full burden of the worldwide average corporate tax and labor may even benefit in some cases. In conclusion, our findings suggest that capital is the main contributor to the corporate tax burden regardless of the economic setting, and that adjustments to the estimated values should be made to reflect central empirical estimates of key elasticities.", "label": "alpaca"}

The school and her father, Keith Morton, reported that she had been “very disturbed” by the incident. Despite the trauma, all pupils are expected to return to school next week. \nThe coach, driven by James Chance from a firm in County Antrim, Northern Ireland, was carrying the students on a languages trip to Cologne, Germany. The school said two staff members had been injured, one of whom had a broken collarbone, while others still need hospital treatment. Two boys have been treated for their injuries and have been allowed to visit their friends at the school.\n\nMelissa's father, Keith, told BBC Essex that his daughter had been emotional since the accident, though she was uninjured. He stated that she had experienced “some teary situations and sleepless nights and it's still quite a shock for her.”\n\nHeadmaster David Taylor said that, although it may be difficult for pupils, he still hopes that trips like this can continue in the future.\n\nThough the cause of the crash is still being investigated, it is clear that this accident has had a lasting effect on the students, staff, and parents of Brentwood School.", "label": "alpaca"}

{"text": "The goal of this study was to compare the efficacy of three widely used methods for inducing cortical excitability changes: transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBSS) and transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS). The effect of each stimulation condition was measured by assessing motor-evoked potential (MEP) amplitudes in a fixed time sequence after stimulation. \n\nThe analysis confirmed a significant enhancement of motor cortex excitability with all three types of active stimulations when compared to a sham stimulation. There was no significant difference between the types of active stimulations, although the time course of the excitatory effects slightly differed. \n\nTrNS resulted in the strongest and tDCS the longest MEP increase when compared to sham. These results suggest that different mechanisms are at play depending on the stimulation method used. Understanding the underlying processes of these stimulation methods could aid in better targeting and optimizing the effects of each one.", "label": "alpaca"}

{"text": "1. We investigated the link between gut microbiota variation and stool consistency using the Bristol Stool Scale, which reflects faecal water content and activity, and is considered a proxy for intestinal colon transit time.\n2. Through 16S rDNA Illumina profiling of faecal samples from 53 healthy women, we evaluated associations between microbiome richness, Bacteroidetes:Firmicutes ratio, enterotypes, and genus abundance with self-reported, Bristol Stool Scale-based stool consistency.\n3. Each sample's microbiota growth potential was calculated to test whether transit time acts as a selective force on gut bacterial growth rates.\n4. Stool consistency strongly correlates with all known major microbiome markers.\n5. It is negatively correlated with species richness, positively associated to the Bacteroidetes:Firmicutes ratio, and linked to Akkermansia and Methanobrevibacter abundance.\n6. Enterotypes are distinctly distributed over the BSS scores.\n7. Based on the correlations between microbiota growth potential and stool consistency scores within both enterotypes, we hypothesise that accelerated transit contributes to colon ecosystem differentiation.\n8. While shorter transit times can be linked to increased abundance of fast-growing species in Ruminococcus-Bacteroides samples, hinting to a washout avoidance strategy of faster replication, this trend is absent in Prevotella-enterotyped individuals.\n9. Within this enterotype, adherence to host tissue appears to be a more likely bacterial strategy to cope with washout.\n10.

The storyline is confused and abbreviated, which leads me to believe that more time was supposed to be devoted to the characters, their motivations, and the war between the gods. An expansion could have provided much-needed clarity and context. \n\nThe movie's most interesting idea is the war between Zeus and Hera, but this is also the area where the movie does the most disappointing job. Hera's followers are depicted as horrible people, but their beliefs and actions are never explained nor do we get any insight into what Zeus' followers do or believe. The movie also fails to explore the possibility that both gods exist, or that only one of them does - such an idea would add an unexpected twist to the plot. With more time this could have been a truly thought-provoking scene. \n\nThe dialogue is bad and the characters are cardboard, but the single bright moment is Hercules' confrontation with his three antagonistic sons. Even in this short scene, the presence of the gods is acknowledged, giving some proof to the idea that the movie is set in an ancient world. Unfortunately, this scene is also the only example of the mythological elements promised in the movie's premise.\n\nIn conclusion, while it may be bad, this movie is still worth a watch because of its unique ideas, especially for viewers looking to kill some time and have a light, thought-provoking viewing experience.", "label": "alpaca"}

Vincent stops at a bar and runs into a very young Richard Gere who has just returned from a tour in the Pacific as a hard-core Marine 'Raider'. Gere's character is already jaded and contemplating desertion, and he takes advantage of Vincent's innocence, stealing his 'baby blue' uniform after getting him drunk and beating him in an alleyway.

Staying with Hudkins parents, Marion attracts all sorts of attention from the towns folks. Mr Hudkins suspects Marion and wonders how a Marine 'Raider' could still be so innocent. The story also brings up the Japanese Internment Camps, as the towns folks go 'hunting' 3 escapees. Marion is shot accidentally during this hunt. But there's still a happy ending, which befuddled me a bit. I would have preferred a little more drama! Anyway, this captures JMV at the peak of his 70's performances. BUSTER AND BILLIE, BABY BLUE MARINE and WHITE LINE FEVER in the mid-70's were amazingly good JMV performances. He was both an action star and a heart-throb all at the same time!!! He made a lot of quality movies during his career, and continued to do so up into the mid 80's with the great TV show Airwolf. He does a very good job in this as 'Hedge', quietly observing the way people treat him (in his uniform) as he travels across the country. He must have performed some of the stunt work as well- there is a harrowing river scene at the end of the movie-and it looks like he's the guy getting tossed down the river to me! But really, at the height of his popularity, this movie could have done so much more with JMV's talent and his looks. Innocence can only be so interesting.

In this paper, we present an additional case of ectopic dentigerous cyst in the right maxillary sinus, as well as the pathogenesis, role of advanced imaging, differential diagnosis, and management.", "label": "alpaca"}

On the other hand we have to deal with sheer incompetency shown by the same Government Agencies that are supposed to keep the above data secure, are instead leaking them left, right and centre! Here is what happened: SEBI and MCA in their eagerness to solve the fraudulent issues surrounding unclaimed/unpaid dividends relating to stocks and mutual funds had mandated that the investor details be put on the websites of all the listed companies and Mutual Fund Houses. There are about 5800 Publicly traded companies at the BSE and almost every one of them have put a Spreadsheet or PDF document containing the following data accessible to the Public without any authentication or checks of any sort.· Name of the Investor· Address· Name of Mutual Funds· Amount· Demat Numbers· Folio Numbers Full name and address together constitutes Personally Identifiable Information (PII). Some companies have also listed the Demat Account Numbers in addition to these Personally Identifiable Information. As these include financial information, it could be further classified as Sensitive PII.

Caveat: The above data is for those investors, whose bank details are not updated with the fund houses/publicly traded companies for them to transfer this money. In my estimate, there are more than a million records of PII out there is public. One of the file I downloaded had about 25000 entries.

{"text": "According to recent reports in the LA Times, the LA Galaxy are nearing an agreement to sign Ashley Cole, with the reigning Premier League champions reportedly using the $800,000 in targeted allocation money (TAM) awarded to them at the beginning of the year. On its face, the move for Cole appears to be completely baffling, particularly given his age and the amount of money the Galaxy would be paying him. After all, Cole is 35 years old and his minutes have been on a steady downward trend since 2010.Moreover, the LA Galaxy’s recent history of high-priced, aging stars has not always panned out. Signings such as Robbie Rogers and Sebastian Lletget (both from Europe) have been great moves, but neither player was necessarily \"undiscovered\" since both were well known entities. The Galaxy have also had their fair share of poor moves, like the signing of Mika Vayrynen, Edson Buddle, Rob Friend, and even Carlo Cudicini, who were all deemed too old and expensive relative to their production level.As innovators and trailblazers, the LA Galaxy should clearly be ahead of the curve when it comes to scouting talent. However, when it comes to their scouting methods, there appears to be a stark contrast between the Galaxy’s innovation and success. Despite the introduction of data analytics, the organization does not seem to have a dedicated data analyst on staff, and have opted for outdated, old-school scouting methods in the past.The good news is that the Galaxy made progress this offseason when it came to signing younger players who are less experienced but still highly promising. This includes the acquisition of Emmanuel Boateng and Joaquin Rivas from the Rapids and the subsequent loan of midfielder Alan Gordon from the Reign. Yet, the addition of Ashley Cole would represent a deviation from this progress, as the 35-year-old Cole is likely to cost a lot, both in terms of salary and potential production.", "label": "alpaca"}

{"text": "We present the results of our numerical experiments examining how the asphericities produced by the standing accretion shock instability ( SASI ) influence the gravitational waveforms in the post-bounce phase of core-collapse supernovae. To obtain neutrino-driven explosions, we parameterize the neutrino fluxes emitted from the central protoneutron star and approximate the neutrino transfer with a light bulb scheme. We find that the waveforms due to the anisotropic neutrino emissions show a monotonic increase with time, whose amplitudes are up to two orders of magnitude larger than the amplitudes from the matter motions outside the protoneutron stars. The amplitudes begin to become larger when the SASI enters the nonlinear phase, in which the deformation of the shocks and the neutrino anisotropy become large. From the spectrum analysis of the waveforms, we find that the amplitudes from the neutrinos are dominant over the ones from the matter motions at frequencies below 10 hertz, which will be within the detection limits of the proposed space-based detectors LCGT and the Advanced LIGO for a supernova at 10 kiloparsecs. As a contribution to the gravitational wave background, we show that the amplitudes from this source could be larger at frequencies above 10 hertz than the primordial gravitational wave backgrounds, but unfortunately, invisible to the proposed space-based detectors.", "label": "alpaca"}

We adopt a self-consistent description of local and extra-galactic substructures and find that the annihilation signal from substructures in the MW dominates over all the other components for angles larger than @xmath0(1) degrees from the Galactic Center, unless an extreme prescription is adopted for the substructures' concentration. We also compute the angular power spectrum of gamma-ray anisotropies and find that, for an optimistic choice of the particle physics parameters, an interesting signature of DM annihilations could soon be discovered by the Fermi LAT satellite at low multipoles, @xmath1, where the dominant contribution comes from MW substructures with mass @xmath2.

{"text": "A startling new study has revealed that the ocean's declining oxygen levels will become noticeable in just a decade or so, due to the planet's warming climate. As the planet's surface temperatures rise, the ocean absorbs less oxygen, with the most serious effects occurring in shallow waters. This drops the amount of oxygen available for marine life, making it more difficult for creatures to survive. This marks a dramatic change from previous predictions which suggested the effects of this drop in oxygen levels wouldn't be noticeable for decades. The new research, led by the National Center for Atmospheric Research and the National Science Foundation, points to 10-15 years as the point at which we could start to see significant effects of climate change on ocean oxygen levels. From there, the effects will steadily worsen, as the atmosphere's higher temperatures continue to slow the oxygen's travel deeper into the ocean. The results of this, and other climate-related studies, are troubling as they demonstrate the rapidity and severity of the risks to the environment created by humanity's ongoing use of fossil fuels.", "label": "alpaca"}

This new field is auxiliary but transforms as a vector under two different lorentz groups, one of them the group of local lorentz transformations, the other an additional global group. This formulation enables a geometric interpretation of the mass and potential terms for gravity in terms of certain volume forms. Furthermore, we were able to derive expressions for the interactions of the vector modes and note that the decoupling limit is much simpler to extract in this approach.

These surveys will have unprecedented sensitivity and area coverage, but will be limited in their ability to detect variability on time scales longer than the lifetime of the surveys. To tackle this issue, we present a new, precision, multi-epoch photometric catalog that spans 60 years by combining the USNO-B and SDSS DR9 catalogs.

It is difficult to know how successful Mourinho could be given the circumstances he faces. On the other hand, Bayern Munich coach Carlo Ancelotti has praised Van Gaal's work and believes there is more to come. Meanwhile, United legend Eric Cantona is a fan of Man City's new manager Pep Guardiola. He believes Guardiola could have revolutionized United, however, it is questionable whether he would have been appointed. Despite this, it is clear that Mourinho faces an immense task to restore the Red Devils to their former glory.", "label": "alpaca"}
{"text": "On Tuesday, March 1, Alec Guessford was supposed to have a straight-forward court day. He was to watch as five of his black classmates taunted, harassed and beat him on a school bus in April; his peers would testify and the court commissioner would make a decision. Little did he know that the beating was to go viral, resulting in 125,000 shares on Facebook and 60,000 views on YouTube before it was removed. The four assailants had already pled guilty to various charges of misdemeanor assault and conspiracy, but the fifth assailant took his chances with a trial before the commissioner. Testimony was given, and in the end, the commissioner ruled in the assailant's favour, determined as she was that it couldn't be called a trial. The result was largely met with disappointment. The Guessfords were left questioning why the commissioner hadn't seen the assault for what it was. The assailant's lawyer focused on the fact that no one had stopped the assault and that witnesses had laughed and taunted the Guessfords afterward. In the end, it wasn't clear if the defense lawyer's strategy had been to shift blame onto the Guessfords or if he genuinely believed that his client had done no wrong. Whatever this was, it could hardly be called a trial.", "label": "alpaca"}

Oxygen has a bond length of 121 pm and an energy of 498 kJ·mol−1, which is smaller than other double bonds or pairs of single bonds within the biosphere. This makes Oxygen a great source of energy for more complex forms of life, such as animals, in cellular respiration (see Biological role).

The underlying storyline is familiar, yet this movie is excellent; both Costner and Kutcher deliver powerful performances that work well off each other and bring out each other's best qualities.

The scene where Costner confronts Kutcher with the personal reasons behind his motivation to join the Coast Guard rescue elite is the film's most unforgettable emotional moment.

{"text": "Peyer's patches (PPs), a key component of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue, play an important role in mucosal immunity. PPs may be involved in the extension of ulcerative colitis (UC) into the ileum. We investigated the magnified endoscopic findings of PPs in the terminal ileum of UC patients. Eighteen UC patients underwent chromoendoscopy before treatment to evaluate the follicle-associated epithelium (FAE) on the PP domes and the surrounding villi. In eight UC patients, the PPs were slightly elevated, covered with FAE, and surrounded by dense and bulky villi. In ten UC patients, the PPs were irregular and the surrounding villi were sparse and atrophic. These abnormalities were associated with minimal mucosal lesions but not with backwash ileitis. Electron microscopy and magnifying endoscopy confirmed that the lesions were reversible following remission with prednisolone-mesalazine therapy.Similar to Crohn's disease patients, UC patients commonly had abnormalities in the FAE on PP domes and the surrounding villi.", "label": "alpaca"}

{"text": "Beavers have given birth to two kits in the wild for the first time since they were hunted to extinction in England and Wales. The two females were found to be pregnant when they were taken in to captivity to be tested for disease. It's not thought that the other female has yet had her kits. The colony of wild beavers was first spotted living on the River Otter in February 2014. In January 2015, Natural England granted a licence to the Devon Wildlife Trust that allowed the beavers to remain on the river, as part of a pilot experiment. This is the first time that an extinct mammal has been re-introduced to England. Other species, such as wild boar, have naturalised after escaping from enclosures. Beavers were hunted to extinction in England and Wales for their valuable fur and glandular oil during the 12th Century and disappeared from the rest of the UK 400 years later. Steve Hussey, from the DWT, said \"We have no plans to tag them at the moment. If we do, it will just be for identification purposes. The less we disturb them the better. \"They are healthy beavers, so they will breed. But they are not like rodents, they only have one litter a year, and they take two to three years to reach sexual maturity. The river system in east Devon is nowhere near filled to capacity. \" Beavers are known as a \"keystone species\" because of the dramatic impact they have on their environment. They fell large and small trees, and create sophisticated dams that hold vast amounts of water. They use these lakes as \"superhighways\" to get to foraging areas. Tom Buckley commented: \"When I saw these new born baby beavers I was totally overwhelmed and I thought it was a miracle. \"One of the kits, however, seemed extremely unhappy to be out in the big wide world and as soon as its mother let it go, it rushed back to its burrow. Not surprising really - the world can be a very scary place.\" Mark Owen, from the Angling Trust, said the fact the young beavers would not be tagged or tracked meant the trial lacked any \"scientific credibility\". \"There is an increasing prospect of a population explosion that could do considerable harm to other wildlife through the uncontrolled damming up of watercourses which can, among other things, prevent fish from reaching their spawning grounds,\" he said. \"This irresponsible programme should never have begun and it won't be long before the substantial sums spent in other European countries in dealing with problems caused by beavers will be required here in the UK.\" But Friends of the Earth campaigner Alasdair Cameron said: \"[Beavers] bring huge benefits to the countryside - boosting biodiversity and keeping the rivers clean - we're delighted that they are back and doing well.\" The DWT is urging people not to search for the kits as they would be disturbed by noise and dogs.

{"text": "The Planck collaboration recently published precise and resolved measurements of the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect in Abell 1656 (the Coma cluster of galaxies). Combining these data with other observations provides a model-independent tension between the Sz and X-ray pressure profiles, with the Sz value being definitely lower than the X-ray one by a factor of @xmath0. We propose that this challenging tension can be resolved by including an additional, non-thermal support to the gravitational equilibrium of the intracluster plasma. Such a component can originate from cosmic ray protons, ongoing turbulence, or relativistic electrons. Given the existing observational constraints on the first two options, we focus on the third and find that the electron population must include both an energetic tail accelerated to @xmath1 responsible for the Coma radiohalo and many more, lower energy electrons. The electron acceleration is started by merging events similar to those which provided the very high central entropy of the thermal intracluster plasma in Coma.", "label": "alpaca"}

Filled with suspense and humor, it keeps the viewer's interest right up until the end.\n\nCary Grant, Victor McLaglen, and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. are inseparable and, in a way, indistinguishable as three quarters of a single organism. Yet it is Sam Jaffe as Gunga Din who steals the show, with a performance of radiant dignity and immense courage. The Thuggee cult, worshippers of the hideous, blood-soaked Kali goddess, had terrorized India for 6 centuries before military forces suppressed it. By the end of the 19th century, their ritualistic stranglings were down to a fraction of their former totality. But the British military is not to be undersestimated.\n\nMontague Love and Eduardo Ciannelli play the major and the fanatical Thuggee guru respectively. Robert Coote, Lumsden Hare, and Cecil Kellaway add to the ensemble cast. The movie is filled with suspense and humor, offering its characters plenty of romantic interludes with minimal fuss. Gunga Din is an exciting, worthy entry to Hollywood's 1939 Golden Year.", "label": "alpaca"}

However, the immunological properties of hDOCs, including their effects on dendritic cell (DC) function, are not fully characterised. hDOCs can be administered either as a cell suspension (Detached hDOCs or det - DCs) or as adherent cells implanted on scaffolds (Adherent hDOCs or adh - DCs).\n\nWe studied the effects of these two different routes of administration on DC function. First, det - DCs downregulate CD80 and CD86 on the DC surface and weakly modulate DC function. Moreover, det - DCs boost the capacity to induce T-cell proliferation and generate CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ T cells. In contrast, adh - DCs suppress DC functions by downregulating CD80 and CD86 and by inhibiting TGF- production. This strongly suppresses DC function, as shown by the decreased capacity to differentiate CD4+CD161+CD196+ Th17 cells.\n\nOverall, our data demonstrate that the type of DC preparation can have an impact on the modulation of the host immune system.

{"text": "This paper provides a systematic study of two classical and one quantum geometric frustrated Ising models, each featuring a competing ordering mechanism.  The classical ordering comes from a coupling of two-dimensional layers, while the quantum model is derived from the quantum dynamics induced by a transverse field. By mapping the Ising models onto a triangular lattice and elastic lattices of non-crossing strings, we derive an exact relation between the spin variables and the displacement field of the strings. Using this map, both for the classical (2+1)d stacked model and the quantum frustrated 2d system, we obtain a microscopic derivation of an effective Hamiltonian which was proposed before on phenomenological grounds within a Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson approach. Our derivation provides the coupling constants and thus the entire transverse field versus temperature phase diagram can be deduced, including the universality classes of both the quantum and the finite temperature transitions. The structure of the ordered phase is obtained from a detailed entropy argument. We compare our predictions to recent simulations of the quantum system and find good agreement. We also analyze the connections to a dimer model on the hexagonal lattice and its height profile representation, providing a simple derivation of the continuum free energy and a physical explanation for the universality of the stiffness of the height profile for anisotropic couplings.", "label": "alpaca"}

Considering various magnetic configurations, we concluded that the system tends toward an noncollinear spin alignment. Analysis of the Heisenberg exchange parameters jij revealed a strong dependence of iron-iron magnetic couplings on the polarization of pd atoms. To account for this effect, we built an extended Heisenberg model with higher-order ( biquadratic ) terms. Minimizing the energy of this Hamiltonian, fully parametrized using the results of calculations, we found a candidate for a ground state of compressed fepd, which can be seen as two interpenetrating “triple-q” phases.", "label": "alpaca"}

{"text": "A crucial element in most signal processing procedures is computing the distance between signals, which is particularly important in multi-party processing applications where the signals belong to different parties. In order to ensure privacy, the signals may themselves be private and the parties to the computation may not be willing to expose them. Solutions proposed to this challenge in the literature generally involve homomorphic encryption schemes, secure multi-party computation, or other cryptographic methods, which often lead to complex computations requiring repeated computations to become impractical. Other solutions involve third parties, making unrealistic assumptions about their trustworthiness. In this paper, we propose an alternate approach based on third-party computation, but without the need for assuming as much trust in the third party. Individual participants to the computation can securely hash their data with shared keys prior to sharing it with the third party. The hashing ensures that the third party is unable to recover any information about the individual signals or their statistics, either from analysis of individual computations or their long-term aggregate patterns. We provide theoretical proof of these properties and empirical demonstration of the feasibility of the computation.", "label": "alpaca"}

{"text": "First, if a Directive's deadline for implementation has passed, a member state may not enforce conflicting laws, and an individual may rely on the Directive in legal proceedings (known as \"vertical direct effect\"). This was seen in Pubblico Ministero v Ratti when the Italian government failed to implement Directive 73/173/EEC on packaging and labelling solvents, resulting in Mr Ratti's business being estoppelled from enforcing a conflicting national law from 1963.\n\n                Second, a Directive can also be invoked by an individual or business in a private lawsuit, not just against a public authority, as seen in CIA Security v Signalson and Securitel. In this case, the Court of Justice held that CIA Security could defend itself against allegations regarding compliance with a Belgian decree on alarm systems, as they had not been notified to the European Commission as required by the Directive.\n\n                Third, if a Directive expresses a general principle of EU law, it can be invoked in legal proceedings before its deadline for implementation. This is seen in Kücükdeveci v Swedex GmbH & Co KG where the German Civil Code §622 stated that the years workers under the age of 25 worked would not count towards the lengthening of the employer's statutory notice period before dismissal. Ms Kücükdeveci had worked for 10 years, from age 18 to 28, and thus claimed age discrimination against the employer on the basis that the law was unlawful. The Court of Justice held that the Directive could be relied on in her favor.\n\n                Fourth, if the defendant is an emanation of the state, even if privatised, then it can still be bound by Directives. In Foster v British Gas plc, the Court of Justice held that Mrs Foster could bring a sex discrimination claim against her employer, British Gas plc, which had special powers to provide basic water services due to state measures.", "label": "alpaca"}

These are employed in geochronologic and thermochronologic studies. Common methods include uranium-lead dating, potassium-argon dating, argon-argon dating and uranium-thorium dating. These techniques are utilized for a variety of applications. Dating of lava and volcanic ash layers embedded within a stratigraphic sequence allow for determining absolute age data for sedimentary rock units which lack radiometric isotopes, thus providing an accurate chronology.

King County's ratings system stands out for more than just its presentation. In other cities, restaurants that receive a poor grade usually seek a do-over inspection, according to research by Daniel Ho, an expert in food safety grades from Stanford Law School who helped King County implement their program. Over time, he says grades get inflated and inspectors divert more of their time to handling appeals rather than conducting new inspections. That's sure to anger some business owners, but the most controversial aspect of the new system may be how the ratings are calculated. Ho has found that ratings often vary by inspector, so a tougher inspector might mark down businesses in ways another might not. To account for differences in inspectors, the county rates a restaurant's performance on a curve, relative to other restaurants under the same inspector's purview. It also takes into account the type of business, so a sushi restaurant won't be held to the same standards as a coffee shop. The county also decided to base its ratings on a three-month average of inspections rather than relying on a single health inspection, making it more difficult for restaurants to game the system by improving their scores on request. The ratings system may be the first of its kind in the United States. The idea for the emojis builds on a growing movement to post health inspection grades on restaurants.

If they had used it more cleverly and introducing it earlier, the movie might have had a few more redeeming qualities. Remember Dragonheart?

The algorithm consists of three phases: assembly of an initial 3D structure from a library of fragments; exhaustive enumeration of all rotatable torsions using values drawn from a knowledge-based list of angles, thereby generating a large set of conformations; and sampling of this set by geometric and energy criteria.  Validation of conformer generators, such as Omega, has often been undertaken by comparing computed conformer sets to experimental molecular conformations from crystallography, usually from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). Such an approach is fraught with difficulty due to the systematic problems with small molecule structures in the PDB. Methods are presented to identify a diverse set of small molecule structures from cocomplexes in the PDB that has maximal reliability. A challenging set of 197 high-quality, carefully selected ligand structures from well-solved models was obtained using these methods. This set will provide a sound basis for comparison and validation of conformer generators in the future.

{"text": "In recent years, the dynamics of two amide i vibrations in a 3D helix has been studied according to a generalized Davydov model. This helix is composed of three spines of hydrogen-bonded peptide units linked by covalent bonds. It was found that the two amide i modes contribute to the characterization of three bound states, called TVBS-I, TVBS-II, and TVBS-III, which respectively occur in low-temperature, high-temperature, and intermediate temperature conditions. In the low-temperature scenario, the bound states exhibit a three-dimensional (3D) nature, which is reflected in the wave functions extending over the three spines of the helix. At biological temperature, the pairs are confined in a given spine and show the same features as the bound states described within a one-dimensional model. Furthermore, the interplay between temperature and 3D nature of the helix is also responsible for the emergence of a third bound state, called TVBS-IV, which is associated with the trapping of two vibrons onto two different spines. The experimental signature of the existence of the bound states is discussed through the simulation of their infrared pump-probe spectroscopic response.

This study's two main objectives are (1) to derive reasonable orbits for a number of new eclipsing binaries, and (2) to evaluate the expected performances by Gaia on eclipsing binaries and the accuracy achievable on the determination of fundamental stellar parameters like masses and radii. It is demonstrated that a 1% precision in basic stellar parameters can be achieved by Gaia on well-observed detached eclipsing binaries if the spectroscopic observations are performed at high enough resolution. Other types of eclipsing binaries (including semi-detached and contact types) and different spectral types will be investigated in future papers from this series.", "label": "alpaca"}

{"text": "Taking full advantage of the law of supply and demand, Coca-Cola Co. has quietly begun testing a vending machine that can automatically raise prices for its drinks in hot weather.This technology is something the Coca-Cola Co. has been looking at for more than a year. In response to increased demand, the machine is able to sense and adjust prices accordingly. Chairman M. Douglas Ivester described how desire for a cold drink can increase during a sports championship final held in the summer heat. “So it is fair that it should be more expensive,” Ivester was quoted as saying in the magazine, Veja. “The machine will simply make this process automatic.” \n\nThe machine adjusts prices based on the temperature outside, using a temperature sensor and a computer chip to track demand. While the concept might seem unfair to a thirsty person, it is an example of the practice of extending what has become common in the airline and other industries - adjusting prices to reflect current demand. Other potential modifications include adjusting prices based on demand at a specific machine, as well as boosting sales at off-hours through discounts and offers.

{"text": "Cancer Research UK stated that the financial burden of cancer is a huge issue across Europe due to disease-related deaths and time off work. This study reveals that the cost of cancer in the EU amounts to a whopping 126 billion euro, with 51 billion euro attributed to healthcare costs such as drug expenses and doctor visits. Lung cancer is the most costly form of the disease. Research from the University of Oxford and Kings College London analysed data from all 27 European Union countries in 2009 and found that lost productivity due to being sick or providing care amounts to 52 billion euros. Of this, 23 billion euros is due to families having to provide care for a loved one. All in all, the total economic burden of cancer for the EU is behind the costs of dementia and cardiovascular disease. The research also revealed that cardiovascular diseases, which include high blood pressure and stroke, cost 169 billion euros, while dementia costs 189 billion euros, in just 15 countries in the west. Dementia has very high costs associated with long-term care while cardiovascular diseases include such a wide range of conditions it affects many more people than cancer. One of the researchers, Dr Ramon Luengo-Fernandez, said: “By estimating the economic burden of several diseases it will be possible to help allocate public research funding towards the diseases with the highest burden and highest expected returns for that investment.” Prof Richard Sullivan, from Kings College London, added: “It is vital that decision-makers across Europe use this information to identify and prioritise key areas. “More effective targeting of funding could even improve survival rates.” Sara Osborne, head of policy at Cancer Research UK, stated: “The mortality rates for cancer in the UK remain higher than many EU countries despite a similar spend on cancer care. “This study reinforces why research is vital to improve our understanding of the causes of cancer - so that we lessen the impact of the disease and develop better ways to prevent and treat the illness.”", "label": "alpaca"}

{"text": "Officials say that in recent months there has been a clear decline in the number of cases of polio in Pakistan, with the number of cases dropping from 199 cases in 2001 to only 7 cases this year. This is largely due to greater access to previously inaccessible populations in Waziristan, as well as an increase in vaccinations in high-risk areas due to the help of the army and funding from the United Arab Emirates.  In addition, arrests of men involved in attacks on polio teams have also helped to decrease the number of attacks. All of this has resulted in Pakistan celebrating the improved figures for polio cases this year. \n\n                Despite this, Pakistan is still not as successful as Afghanistan and Nigeria, who have both reported zero cases this year. The main difference between the success of the three countries is that Afghanistan and Nigeria have managed to maintain a consistent level of access to populations for vaccinations, whereas Pakistan is still struggling to overcome the legacy of militant-imposed bans as well as the arrests of polio workers in the past.  Although there has been progress, there is still clearly more work to be done in order for Pakistan to fully eradicate polio.", "label": "alpaca"}
{"text": "We propose a review of recent developments on entanglement and non-classical effects in collective two-atom systems and present a unified physical picture of the many predicted phenomena. The collective effects have brought into sharp focus some of the most basic features of quantum theory, such as non-classical states of light and entangled states of multi-atom systems. These entangled states are linear superpositions of the internal states of the system which, due to their peculiar nature, cannot be separated into product states of the individual atoms. This quantum-mechanical effect has played a crucial role in numerous discussions of the nature of quantum measurements and, in particular, in the development of quantum communications. Additionally, much of the fundamental interest in entangled states is tied to its practical applications, ranging from quantum computation, information processing, cryptography, and interferometry to atomic spectroscopy.", "label": "alpaca"}

{"text": "The use of digital technology has grown rapidly, giving rise to systems based on cognitive infocommunications. Boosting, which is a method of combining multiple weak classifiers into one powerful predictive rule, is a powerful tool for ensuring robustness in cognitive systems. Theory suggests that boosting can reduce the error of existing learning algorithms, resulting in “learners” that perform better than random guessing. Adaboost and support vector machines (SVM) are two successful classification methods that share the aim of maximizing the minimal margin on a training set. In this paper, we investigate the impact of Adaboost on the supervised algorithm SVM for a multi-class phoneme recognition problem.

{"text": "The upcoming Republican primary debates present an intriguing conundrum for party leaders: how to select a large enough field of candidates to provide viewers with an interesting show, while at the same time avoiding chaos and an overwhelmed audience. \n\n                    One idea is to have a few more candidates than is traditionally allowed, and then to divide them into two groups and hold two debates in quick succession. The winners of these \"tournament\"-style debates would then face off in the main event. This format would provide viewers with exciting debates without the potential for too many participants, while also allowing audience engagement to be gauged. \n\n                    Additionally, the media hosting the debates could require candidates to use online tools that measure audience engagement.

There was no real story and the characters remained beautiful, yet lacked any real depth or emotion.

Do not get me wrong, some people can make that funny, Dani Levy can't, not for me, anyway. \n\n                The main problem I have with this movie is that I can't see a reason behind the way the main characters behave.

They are both rather bland characters. Their children are boring aside from the fact that they are sexually attracted to each other (well, one is a lesbian now, but raises the daughter she has with her cousin).

{"text": "With Liverpool linked with some big-name targets under new manager Jürgen Klopp, we take a look at how he fared in the transfer market at Borussia Dortmund. The 48-year-old may only have been in the Anfield hot-seat for a matter of days, but he is already being linked with bringing some of his former Dortmund players to Merseyside. Brendan Rodgers' time in charge will be remembered for the vast sums of money spent despite a lack of successful signings, and Klopp will be under similar scrutiny to perform in that respect. It will be intriguing to see how he fares. The German achieved wonderful success during his seven years with Dortmund, but how did he perform in the transfer market? Free transfers and loans Shinji Kagawa (Free, 2010) Signed from Japanese side Cerezo Osaka in the summer of 2010, Shinji Kagawa was a complete unknown when he arrived in Germany. He became an instant success story under Klopp, enjoying two tremendous seasons with Dortmund prior to his exit in 2012. Blessed with great technical quality and a shrewd footballing brain, Kagawa wreaked havoc in his No.10 role, scoring 29 goals in 71 appearances for BVB, and assisting many more. Having failed at Man United – mainly due to being played inexplicably out of position by both Sir Alex Ferguson and David Moyes – Kagawa made an emotional return to Dortmund in 2014, for a bargain £5.6 million, where he remains a key man. Lukasz Piszczek (Free, 2010) Lukasz Piszczek was brought in from Hertha Berlin during the same time as Kagawa, and was another who few knew much about. The Pole had been moulded into a right-back at his former club, having initially shone as a winger, and he immediately made an impression at Dortmund. His attacking qualities came to the fore under Klopp – he linked up brilliantly down the right with compatriot Jakub Blaszczykowski – but defensively he was also rock solid. Piszczek has matured into one of Europe's finest right-backs over the last five years, and was a key player for the club as they won back-to-back Bundesliga titles and reached the 2013 Champions League Final. Bargain buys Robert Lewandowski (£3.33m, 2010) Like a number of players mentioned above and below, it's vital to stress that Robert Lewandowski was far from the superstar he is today when he joined Dortmund for £3.33 million. This is where Klopp deserves huge credit. The Poland striker made his way to Germany from Lech Poznan in 2010 – Blackburn had nearly signed him two years earlier – and it wasn't long before he fired his side to success. Nine goals in his first season was a modest return, even though Dortmund still won the league, but he found the net 94 times in the three years that followed.

First, differences and similarities between various perspectives on addiction and addiction behavior in different substances were obtained.

Meanwhile, the recovery time for recession is even longer, taking 7 days to return to full activity. These findings suggest that laparoscopic colorectal surgery is associated with a more lengthy recovery period compared to other laparoscopic procedures.", "label": "alpaca"}

{"text": "Russell McKeever was locked away in January after he admitted causing the 2014 collision which led to the death of Colin Taylor, from Stonehaven. Prosecutors argued that the sentence handed down to McKeever, of Dundee, was too lenient. Judges at the Court of Criminal Appeal in Edinburgh rejected the appeal. The 42-year-old was sentenced at the High Court in Livingston by Lord Turnbull, who reduced the sentence from six years to four to account for McKeever's guilty plea. McKeever drove on the wrong side of the Brechin to Arbroath road and crashed into Mr Taylor's car, killing him instantly. His widow Julie underwent 12 hours of emergency surgery after sustaining multiple fractures in the crash. Her victim impact statement was described as an impassioned and powerful description of the devastating consequences of the collision. The appeal was heard before Lady Smith, Lady Dorrian and Lord Bracadale. The Crown argued that Lord Turnbull had failed to weigh the gravity of the offence with due seriousness. It noted that McKeever was almost three times the legal blood alcohol limit at the time and had two previous convictions for speeding. In advocate depute Bruce Erroch's submission to the judges, the Crown argued that the sentence of six years imprisonment was unduly lenient and should be replaced with a sentence of eight years. The judges ultimately ruled that Lord Turnbull's sentence could not be called unreasonable or unsatisfactory.

We find that the evolution of the entanglement entropy for these two systems is nearly identical, as expected from the ‘quasi-particle’ picture.

What if you wanted to, say, arm a 20-person paramilitary group to overthrow a West African government in a Internet-armed coup d'état? \n                 Could a band of anonymous weapon mongers prepare me and 19 imaginary compatriots for illegal warfare? \n                 If you've got a spare million or so, looks like the answer is yes. \n                 The Amazon comparison might not be fair—The Armory wants to make itself hard to access (for obvious reasons that have to do with not going to prison), so it's not as easy as just firing up any old website. \n                 In fact, it's not really on the web in any traditional sense. \n                 To get to The Armory, you need to deploy a free piece of software called TOR. \n                 Originally (and ironically) developed by the Navy, it's become the anonymizing software par excellence among criminals, hackers, schemers, and the otherwise paranoid. \n                 TOR routes and reroutes your connection to the Internet through a sprawling maze of encrypted nodes around the world, making it a herculean feat to find out who's who. \n                 The Armory's URL—ayjkg6ombrsahbx2.onion—reflects that, a garbled string of letters and numbers deliberately impossible to memorize. \n                 Once you're actually signed in, you then have to turn to Bitcoins as mandatory currency, a further exercise in computer secrecy and complexity in itself.", "label": "alpaca"}

{"text": "We consider a full-duplex (FD) two-way amplify-and-forward relay system, where imperfect cancelation of loopback self-interference (Si) is present due to limitations in digital-to-analog converter. Multiple antennas at the relay can help suppress residual Si, but beamforming is necessary to maintain a balance between Si suppression and desired signal transmission. Moreover, the relay beamforming matrix should be updated every time slot since the residual Si from the previous time slot is amplified by the current beamforming matrix and added to the received signals from the two sources in the current time slot.  We derive the optimally balanced relay beamforming and receive beamforming matrices in closed form based on minimum mean square error, taking into account the propagation of the residual Si across time slots. Additionally, we propose beamforming designs using only the channels of the latest time slots, not from the first time slot.

{"text": "New rock units are often created through the process of deformation. Faulting and other deformational events result in an increase in elevation for certain areas of the rock unit, while causing erosion of the depositing material on the other. As the topography changes, sediments are thereby transferred onto the low-elevation side of the fault. This continues to create a gradient in the landscape, regardless of any movement from the sediments. Additionally, movement from the fault enables continued transfer of material and consequently the preservation of the gradient. Volcanic activity and igneous intrusions respond to the ongoing deformation. Volcanic ashes and lavas accumulate on the high-elevation side, while igneous intrusions traverse the fault plane from below and form dikes in large numbers. Furthermore, these intrusions happen to form a \"swarm\" around the lava tube. Large amounts of intrusions surrounding it demonstrate the activity on the Canadian shield and other volcanic regions.", "label": "alpaca"}

Because of their release into the circulation, miR levels in plasma and other biological fluids can serve as diagnostic and prognostic disease biomarkers.

Our direct hybridization approach has enabled the detection of sub-femtomolar concentration of miR-21 and miR-10b in human plasma in pancreatic cancer patients.\n\nThrough LSPR-based measurements, we have shown nearly 4-fold higher concentrations of miR-10b than miR-21 in plasma of pancreatic cancer patients.

{"text": "The key feature of weak measurements on quantum systems is the reduction of back-action to negligible levels. In order to observe the non-classical characteristics of weak measurements, it is more important to avoid additional back-action errors than it is to avoid errors in the actual measurement outcome. This paper demonstrates how an optical weak measurement of diagonal (PM) polarization can be realized by path interference between the horizontal (H) and vertical (V) polarization components of the input beam. The strength of the measurement can then be controlled by rotating the H and V polarizations toward each other. This well-controlled operation effectively generates the back-action without additional decoherence, while the visibility of the interference between the two beams only limits the measurement resolution. Experimental results confirm that our method provides a realization of weak measurements that is extremely robust against experimental imperfections. We submit this work to the New J.

Mr Firtash denies the allegations, which centre around bribery charges relating to the Indian government. He was first arrested in 2014 but released on bail. After a series of appeals, including arguing that the US was attempting to interfere in Ukrainian politics, a higher court has now overturned an earlier decision and the justice minister will now make the final decision. Mr Firtash was previously an ally of deposed Ukraine leader Viktor Yanukovych, so the case has already raised questions about whether the US is targeting him due to his past association with Mr Yanukovych. The case has also come to light at a particularly controversial time, following the forced resignation of Michael Flynn over misleading Vice President Mike Pence over his talks with the Russian ambassador during the presidential transition. It is unknown whether the case could be further connected to the Trump administration. If extradited, Mr Firtash could face prosecution from the US, so what information could he provide that may be incriminating for the Trump administration? There is speculation Mr Firtash may try to negotiate a plea bargain in order to avoid prosecution, although no deal has been confirmed. What information he has could be highly significant in any such negotiations, so the implications of this case are far-reaching.", "label": "alpaca"}

He's 14 years old, and is supposed to be the hero of this story, but oddly enough... he's dead.\"Originally a manga by Yoshihiro Togashi, YuYu Hakusho (also romanized as Yuu Yuu Hakusho) tells the story of Yusuke Urameshi, a bitter, beleaguered, junior high punk — and legendary street fighter. One particularly bad day gets worse for Yusuke after he dies saving the life of a small boy from a car accident. He discovers that the forces of the Spirit World were expecting the boy to miraculously survive the accident but did not expect Yusuke to even be a part of it. Because of this surprising (if ultimately useless) Heroic Sacrifice, they offer Yusuke a chance to return from the dead. With the help of Botan (a perky female shinigami \"Angel of Death\" or essentially \"Grim Reaper\") and the approval of Koenma (the snarky son of King Enma, the judge of the dead in the Buddhist belief system, and the part-time stand-in for his father) Yusuke returns to the living world.But Koenma has other plans for Yusuke, as both his fighting ability and newfound spirit awareness makes him a prime candidate to be a Spirit Detective, an agent of the spirit world hunting down renegade demons who threaten peace on Earth. With much reluctance, Yusuke takes on the job, and finds himself facing all manner of supernatural baddies. Lucky for him, he has the help of Botan as a liaison and tactical support. Early on in his career they send him to the Old Master Genkai, a short, crotchety old woman who nevertheless is a highly capable spiritual guru and martial artist.As his closest teammates, he gathers some more than capable fighting partners in the form of Kazuma Kuwabara, his old school rival; Kurama, a benevolent reformed fox-spirit trapped in a human body; and Hiei, a not-so-benevolent, not-so-reformed demon who reluctantly tags along with Yusuke and his entourage as part of his sentence.", "label": "alpaca"}

In the case of QDs grown on a distributed Bragg reflector, the photoluminescence intensity is enhanced by more than one order of magnitude, whereas the single QD lines are broadened as compared to the case of QDs grown on a ZnTe buffer. Structural and chemical analysis reveal an unintentional formation of a thin ZnSe layer induced by the growth interruption needed for the deposition of the QDs sheet.

{"text": "Hormones with a small molecular structure play an important role in the development and upkeep of an adult mammalian organism. On the molecular level, they regulate a plethora of biological pathways, taking part in the interaction of specific nuclear receptors which are hormone-dependent transcription factors. Nuclear hormone receptors interact with coactivators, corepressors, basal transcription factors, and other transcription factors in order to modulate the activity of target genes in a manner that is dependent on the tissue, age, and developmental and pathophysiological states. The biological effect of this mechanism becomes apparent not earlier than 30 minutes after hormonal stimulus. In addition, small-molecule hormones modify the function of the cell through a number of non-genomic mechanisms, involving interaction with proteins located in the plasma membrane, the cytoplasm, as well as with proteins located in other cellular membranes and in non-nuclear cellular compartments. The identity of such proteins is still under investigation; however, it seems that extracellular fractions of nuclear hormone receptors commonly serve this function. A direct interaction of small-molecule hormones with membrane phospholipids and with mRNA is also postulated. In these mechanisms, the reaction to hormonal stimulus appears within seconds or minutes.", "label": "alpaca"}
{"text": "51.5% of kidney transplant recipients have been reported to develop hypercalcemia (HC), with peak levels of calcium present around the third month after transplant and later levels that slowly decrease and stabilize. Different factors have been linked to HC after transplant, with the most widely accepted theory being that of post-transplant hyperparathyroidism (PT-HPT) of moderate to severe degree.

Despite this, there is no conclusive evidence that controlling serum calcium levels could avoid these effect. The best measure to take is to treat PT-HPT during the uraemic stages, either through parathyroidectomy (PTX) before or after transplant, or through the use of calcimimetic drug, cinacalcet.

{"text": "We investigate the escape of cosmic ray (CR) electrons from supernova remnants (SNRs) to interstellar space. We show that CR electrons escape in order from high to low energies, while the escape starts later than the beginning of the Sedov phase at an SNR age of ~40 and the maximum energy of runaway CR electrons is below the knee at about ~100 GeV. This is due to the synchrotron radiation which lowers their energies. Highest energy CR electrons will be directly probed by AMS-02, CALOR, CTA, and LHAASO experiments, or have been already detected by HESS. Magic also serves as a cutoff in the CR electron spectrum. In addition, we also calculate the spatial distribution of runaway CR electrons and their radiation spectra around SNRs. Contrary to common belief, the maximum photons of synchrotron radiation around ~1022 erg/Hz are emitted by runaway CR electrons, which have been caught up by the shock. Inverse Compton scattering by runaway CR electrons can dominate the gamma-ray emission from runaway CR nuclei via pion decay, and both are detectable by CTA and LHAASO as clues to the CR origin and the amplification of magnetic fluctuations around the SNR. We also discuss middle-aged and/or old SNRs as unidentified very-high-energy gamma-ray sources.", "label": "alpaca"}

I'm at a loss as to why this movie was ever made. I've seen my fair share of flicks and the ones that really irk me are the ones that make me furious. This one made me furious. The situations were senseless at best. If I made a movie like this, it would be a short film. Really, those hillbilly stereotypes in the movie were beyond stupid.

{"text": "We introduced a tight-binding chain with a single impurity to act as a quantum data bus for perfect quantum state transfer. Our proposal was based on the weak coupling limit of the two outermost quantum dots to the data bus. We first showed that the data bus had an energy gap between the ground and first-excited states in the single-particle case due to the impurity. Connecting two quantum dots to two sites of the data bus enabled a high-fidelity and long-distance quantum state transfer. Numerical simulations were performed for a finite system, and the results agreed well with the effective coupling strength analytically derived. Moreover, we studied the robustness of this quantum communication protocol in the presence of disorder in the couplings between the nearest-neighbor quantum dots, and found that the gap of the system played an important role in robust quantum state transfer.", "label": "alpaca"}

A pooling of previous studies was conducted, utilizing individual patient data to adjust for potential confounders. Results showed that overall, there was a 5% increase in risk of type 1 diabetes per 5-year increase in maternal age, but this result was highly variable among different studies. Studies with a low risk of bias demonstrated a more marked increase of 10%. After adjusting for potential confounders, the magnitude of the impact of maternal age on type 1 diabetes risk was unchanged. These results indicate that maternal age is a risk factor for type 1 diabetes in children, but the strength of the association varied among different studies.", "label": "alpaca"}

Many viewers were seen sniffling and dabbing their eyes and I was completely swept away by the passionate love between Victoria and Albert, despite the political obstacles in their way. Sir John Conroy, Victoria's scheming advisor, was a bit of a caricature, but rumour has it he was also the illegitimate father of the young queen. This theory could have been explored further, but overall the movie is a captivating blend of history and romance.

UHI archaeologists have proposed to re-enact this practice in the same location. The volunteers will complete a questionnaire with 10 questions designed to record their thoughts and feelings during the two minutes of drumming. This study, known as archaeoacoustics, has previously given archaeologists insight into the acoustics of Neolithic temples in England and Ireland. Recent discoveries in Scotland show that prehistoric people practiced various rituals involving drums as well. For example, last month UHI archaeologists along with colleagues from Manchester and Lancashire unearthed a complex of Bronze Age buildings at Tresness in Sanday. The houses were believed to have been buried by sand dunes in the second millennium BC. Also, the remains of hazelnuts eaten by some of Skye's earliest inhabitants were found in December at an excavation above Staffin Bay.

{"text": "ulcerative colitis (UC) is debilitating and carries a high risk of colon cancer. Apoptosis of inflammatory cells is a key mechanism regulating UC. We recently showed that American Ginseng (AG), and to a greater extent, a hexane fraction of AG (HAG) can cause apoptosis and suppress UC. Here, we tested the hypothesis that HAG suppresses UC through a p53-mediated mechanism. We found only a limited impact of p53 in the ability of HAG to induce inflammatory cell apoptosis and suppress UC in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we found that HAG could cause a G1 arrest of HCT116 colon cancer cells, independent of p53 status. These findings are significant because they suggest that HAG might be very effective in targeting both inflammatory cells and cancer cells, as it induces apoptosis of inflammatory cells and causes a G1 arrest in both p53/ and wild-type p53 colon cancer cells.", "label": "alpaca"}

It has become clear that the only way to deal with the most serious economic issues facing our country—inequality, underemployment, wage stagnation—is not just to elect a Democrat as president in the November elections but to completely destroy the Republican Party. To do so, we will have to think beyond particular candidates and specific elections. We will have to think more radically, to propose more fundamental reforms. The Constitution of 1787 offers far too many nooks and crannies in the cobwebbed architecture of our political system in which Republicans can hide out and bide their time before attempting another hostile takeover of our democracy. Because the founders-approved option of amending the Constitution is, for the time being, unavailable to us, we will have to figure out ways of amending it without formally amending it, in order to end the artificially enhanced prominence of a party that has been so malignant in its current form. First, we need a plan to immediately end the gerrymandering of congressional districts. Without taking this step, there could be no hope of returning the people's chamber to the people's hands. If we wait until after the next census, in 2020, it will be too late.

To obtain the radiation spectrum in the classical domain, we derive a general expression for the spectral distribution and characteristic frequency of an electron in arbitrary motion via Schwinger's method. The radiation patterns of the ultrarelativistic electron are represented in terms of the acceleration of the particle. The same results can be obtained by considering that the motion of the electron can be formally described as an evolution due to magnetic and electric forces. Defining an effective electromagnetic field, which combines the magnetic field with the fictitious electric field associated to the curvature and drift motion, allows us to obtain all the physical characteristics of the radiation. In the quantum domain, this approach allows the study of the effects of the inhomogeneities and curvature of the magnetic field on the radiative transitions rates of electrons between low-lying Landau levels and the ground state.", "label": "alpaca"}
{"text": "The aim of this study was to investigate the association between body mass index (BMI) and weight changes with disability transitions and mortality among Brazilian older adults. Data from the Health, Well-being, and Aging in Latin America and the Caribbean Study, conducted in Sao Paulo, Brazil (2000 and 2006), was used to examine the impact of obesity on disability and mortality, as well as weight changes on health transitions related to disability. Logistic and multinomial regression models were used in the analyses. Individuals who were obese were more likely than those of normal weight to have limitations in activities of daily living (ADL) and instrumental activity of daily living (IADL), and to experience higher incidence of ADL and IADL limitations and lower recovery from Nursing-Home Functional Status (NFS) limitations. Compared to those who maintained their weight, those who gained weight experienced higher incidence of ADL and NFS limitations, even after controlling for initial BMI. Higher mortality among overweight individuals was only found when the reference category was remaining free of NFS limitations. The findings of this study stress the importance of maintaining a normal weight for preventing disability at older ages.", "label": "alpaca"}
{"text": "We present and analyze a pointed PSPC observation of the Seyfert galaxy NGC 4051. The X-ray spectrum consists of a powerlaw modified by absorption edges and an additional soft excess during the high state in source flux. Modeling the spectrum in terms of warm absorption yields a large column density of the ionized material of N_H = 22.7 and an ionization parameter of log\\phi = 0.4. These properties are essentially constant throughout the observation, whereas the luminosity changes by more than a factor of 4. The underlying powerlaw is in its steepest observed state, with a photon index Γ = 2.3. Consulting information from optical observations, evidence for a separate EUV bump component in NGC 4051 is provided. The impact of several parameters on the deduced properties of the ionized material is critically assessed. In particular, the influence of dust mixed with the warm gas is explored and shown to constrain the history or density of the absorber. The absorber-intrinsic optical-UV line spectrum is predicted and the possibility of a warm absorber origin of one of the observed emission line regions in NGC 4051 is investigated. Consequences for the narrow-line Seyfert 1 character of NGC 4051 are discussed.", "label": "alpaca"}

{"text": "We investigate the thermoelectric and heat-to-work conversion performance of an interacting, multi-level quantum dot (QD) weakly coupled to electronic reservoirs. We focus on the sequential tunneling regime, and study the dynamics of the charge in the QD by means of master equations for the probabilities of occupation. From here, we compute the charge and heat currents in the linear response regime, assuming a generic multi-terminal setup and for low temperatures (quantum limit). We derive formulas for the power factor and figure of merit for a QD-based heat engine, identifying optimal working conditions which maximize output power and efficiency of heat-to-work conversion. Beyond the linear response, we concentrate on the two-terminal setup. We first study the thermoelectric non-linear coefficients, assessing the consequences of large temperature and voltage biases. We then investigate the conditions which optimize the performance of a heat engine, finding that, in the quantum limit, output power and efficiency at maximum power can almost be simultaneously maximized by choosing appropriate values of electrochemical potential and bias voltage. Finally, we study how energy level degeneracy can increase the output power.", "label": "alpaca"}

However, this project is still far from completion. The challenge of completing the ERA by the deadline is attributed to complex issues, such as differences in national laws and regulations, which make it difficult for researchers to move from one country to another. This slows progress in research and development, and delays the Union’s ambitions of creating a competitive knowledge economy. To achieve this, the Commission has taken various initiatives such as the Innovation Union and the Marie Curie Actions. But without proper, continued investments and support, the ERA will never reach its full potential. To make progress in creating this area of free movement of knowledge, the EU must continue to push for the completion of the ERA.

{"text": "The purpose of social work practices is undergoing major transformations due to changes in the governance of health and social policies, which are based on two interconnected logics. The first is managerial and is based on New Public Management principles, while the second is clinical and relies on evidence-based practices. This has caused a relative standardization of clinical practices to emerge, which is articulated in two dimensions. Firstly, social workers should view it as a normative system that shapes their practices, while secondly it is also composed of incorporated and collective routines that support their professional autonomy. \n\nThe analysis of representations of standardization from a corpus of interviews with 10 case managers from two sites of the Prisma pilot project in France reveals a weak conceptualization of the practice. Though some forms of standardization, such as tools for information exchange and evaluation, are seen as vectors of efficiency in clinical practice, these remain rare and marginalized. Furthermore, social workers have a complex relationship with the multifaceted nature of standardization, which is both embraced and resisted by the profession. Therefore, greater empirical research is required to understand how standardization is affecting the practices of social workers.", "label": "alpaca"}
{"text": "Because of their universal nature, Fano fluctuations are expected to influence the response of Superconducting Nanowire Single-Photon Detectors (SNSPDs). We predict that the photon counting rate as a function of bias current in SNSPDs is described by an integral over a transverse coordinate-dependent complementary error function. This error function describes the smearing of local responses due to Fano fluctuations of the amount of energy deposited into the electronic system. The finite width of the photon counting rate versus current arising from Fano fluctuations is dominant in narrow-nanowire SNSPDs. In wide-nanowire SNSPDs, strong coordinate dependence of local responses due to vortex-antivortex unbinding and vortex entry from edges causes Fano fluctuations to smear singularities imprinted by vorticity on the transition part of the counting rate curve. We demonstrate good agreement between theory and experiments for a series of bath temperatures and photon energies in narrow-wire Wide-SNSPDs. The time-resolved hotspot relaxation curves predicted by Fano fluctuations match the Lorentzian shapes observed in experiments over the whole range of bias currents investigated, except for their tails.\n\n<nooutput>", "label": "alpaca"}

But as a mobile device maker, it is unproven, and little is known about key features it has promised. “Hydrogen One is the foundation of a future multi-dimensional media system,” the firm’s press release reads, going onto explain that the device will be modular, meaning certain parts can be interchanged, adding or subtracting pieces of hardware to make the device do different things. However, no additional modules will be available when the phone is first launched, the company said, and aside from vague patent applications that is all that is known about the firm’s plans. Perhaps even more ambitious is the company’s promise of a holographic display that does not require any kind of special glasses.

An Ah Plus mixture was then placed on the dried samples and the contact angles were measured using a dynamic contact angle analyzer. \n\nThe results showed a significant difference in the contact angle of Ah Plus formed on the dentine irrigated with the two regimens. The contact angle of Ah Plus on the dentine irrigated with the EDTAC solution was significantly lower than that with the EDTA solution (p<0.05).\n\nTherefore, it can be concluded that the irrigation regimen containing EDTAC was more effective than EDTA in promoting the wettability of dentine and the flow of Ah Plus.", "label": "alpaca"}
{"text": "Infrared thermography (IRT) is a real-time, non-contact diagnostic tool which has the potential for a wide range of neurosurgical applications.  In this case, we describe the intraoperative use of this technique in a single patient with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM).  An 86-year-old female was admitted to the clinic with a 2-month history of slowly progressing left-sided paresis. Neuroimaging studies revealed an irregular, space-occupying process consistent with a malignant glioma in the right fronto-temporo-insular region.  An elective surgical intervention was performed by using 5-aminolevulinic acid fluorescence (blue400, OPMI) and intraoperative IRT brain mapping (LWIR, 1.25mrad, 0.05CNd). \n\n  After dura opening, the cerebral surface appeared inconspicuous. However, IRT revealed a colder area (T1.01C), well corresponding to the cortical epicenter of the lesion. The underlying tumor was partially excised, and the histologically confirmed the result was GBM. \n\nIn summary, this case suggests that IRT may be a useful technique for subcortical convexity brain tumor localization. Further studies with a large number of patients are needed to prove the reliability of this method in GBM surgery.", "label": "alpaca"}

{"text": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the outcomes of the hybrid technique of posterior lamellar keratoplasty (DMEK-S).  Materials and Methods: A total of 71 eyes of 55 patients were enrolled in a single-center study and underwent DMEK-S with a hybrid lamella implanted using a solution implantation technique due to endothelial dysfunction. Visual acuity and endothelial cell density were studied as outcome measures. Results: The rate of endothelial cell loss caused by surgery was 43.8%. During followups, we observed the stabilization of postoperative findings, or at least a very low rate of corneal endothelial cell loss. The UCDVA and BCDVA dramatically improved postoperatively. The rebubbling rate in our group of patients was 61.9%. We replaced the lamella due to its failure or malfunction in 17 patients (23.9%). Conclusion: In summary, DMEK-S combines the advantages of DSEK/DSAEK and DMEK. The central zone of bare Descemet’s membrane and endothelium allows for very good visual outcomes, and the peripheral rim allows for better manipulation of the lamella during implantation. It is an effective method of treating the endothelial dysfunction of various etiologies, but the high complication rate needs to be addressed before widespread implementation of the technique in the future.", "label": "alpaca"}

{"text": "A hole in a two-dimensional Ising antiferromagnet was believed to be infinitely heavy due to the string of wrongly-oriented spins it creates as it moves, trapping it near its original location. Trugman showed that, in fact, the hole acquires a finite effective mass due to contributions from so-called “Trugman loop” processes, where the hole goes nearly twice around closed loops, first creating and then removing wrongly-oriented spins, and ending up at a different lattice site. This generates effective second- and third-nearest-neighbor hopping terms that keep the quasiparticle on the sublattice it was created on. Here, we investigate the trapping of the quasiparticle near a single attractive non-magnetic impurity placed at one lattice site. We consider the two cases with the quasiparticle and impurity being on the same versus on different sublattices. The main result is that even though the quasiparticle cannot see the bare disorder in the latter case, the coupling to magnons generates an effective renormalized disorder on its own sublattice, which is strong enough to create bound states, although with a very different spectrum when compared to when the quasiparticle and impurity are on the same sublattice.", "label": "alpaca"}

In Keck and Mithouard, two importers challenged the legality of their prosecution under a French competition law which aimed to prevent cut-throat competition but which, in fact, negatively affected them. The Court held that, as \"in law and in fact\" selling arrangements are not altering a product's content, they are outside the scope of Article 34 and do not need to be justified. Furthermore, in Konsumentombudsmannen v De Agostini, the Court reviewed and upheld Swedish bans on advertising to children under 12 and misleading commercials for skin care products, while at the same time emphasizing that total marketing bans may be disproportionate if they are the \"only effective form of promotion enabling [a trader] to penetrate\" the market. In Konsumentombudsmannen v Gourmet AB, the Court further suggested that a total ban for advertising alcohol on the radio, TV, and in magazines might fall within Article 34, given its effects on overcoming existing \"traditional social practices and local habits and customs\" to purchase the items, yet again with the caveat that this should ultimately be decided by the national courts.

{"text": "Adeno- associated virus (AAV) has been developed as a promising human gene therapy vector, particularly Recombinant AAV Vector (RAAV) has the potential to transduce host cells by crossing at least three physiological barriers including plasma membrane, endosomal membrane and nuclear envelope. To date, the AAV delivery mechanism has not been fully explored at the single viral particle level. \n \n In this study, we employed High-Speed Super-Resolution Single-Point Edge-Excitation Sub-Diffraction (Speed) microscopy to map the events of single RAAV2 particles infecting live human cells with an unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution of 912 nm and 220 ms. Data reveals that RAAV2 particles are imported through nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) rather than nuclear membrane budding into the nucleus. Additionally, approximately 17% of the RAAV2 molecules starting from the cytoplasm successfully traverse the NPCs to reach the nucleoplasm, suggesting that NPCs act as a strict selective step for AAV delivery. This study lastly suggests a new pathway to improve AAV vectors for human gene therapy.", "label": "alpaca"}
{"text": "Fashion Week is an important event, not only for the industry but also for the global economy, as it contributes £28 billion to the UK economy and employs 880,000 people. The \"see now, buy now\" trend has changed how the fashion world works, making it easier for people to access the new designs as soon as they are presented on the runway. This has both positive and negative effects. On the one hand, this allows fashion lovers to keep up with the trends and be on the cutting edge of style. On the other hand, it could reduce the allure and exclusivity of some of the designs. Additionally, some people worry that this will harm smaller boutiques, as the high street stores will be able to replicate the designs more quickly and cheaply. Despite this, Fashion Week continues to be an important event in the fashion industry. Every season, it brings together top designers, fashion journalists, bloggers, buyers and retailers from all over the world. The showcasing of the latest trends and designs allows people to stay informed regarding the latest fashion trends, but it also puts pressure on designers to create something that will stand out and capture the public's imagination.

The scientific community is unanimous in its conclusion that climate change is the primary threat to the health of the world's coral reefs, with the worst-ever outbreak of mass coral bleaching causing an estimated quarter of the coral on the Great Barrier Reef to be killed. Scientists warn of the risk of complete collapse in the face of further global warming, and have urged the Australian government to take immediate steps to limit the effects of climate change, including by ending the approval of new coal mines.\n                This call to action was given a wide audience by the Australian media, including The Guardian, The Daily Mail, SBS, Nine News, Buzzfeed and Mashable. \n                However, one place you couldn't read it was in The Australian, whose Environment Editor Graham Lloyd has written several recent stories suggesting coral bleaching ain't as bad as many have claimed. \n                The LA Times, The Jakarta Post, Canada's CBC and Mashable also thought it a big enough story to report on.\n                Yet again, Graham Lloyd's latest article on the subject, which appeared just as the Hawaii symposium ended, was headlined: \n                GREAT BARRIER BATTLEGROUND \n                with a subtitle pointing out that: \n                The bleaching of parts of the reef is dividing the scientific world. \n                But was this actually right? \n                Those coral reef experts meeting in Hawaii say no. Indeed, Professor Ruth Gates, president of the International Society for Reef Studies, which co-organised the symposium, told Media Watch: \n                Almost every single member of the conference of 2500 people stood up saying that they felt that bleaching and climate change pose a significant threat to the existence of coral reefs.

{"text": "We study the potential of the CNGS beam in constraining the parameter space of a model with one sterile neutrino distinguishing it from three active ones by an mass squared difference. We perform our analysis using the Opera detector as a reference (which can be upgraded to include a detailed simulation of the Icarus detector). We find that the channel with the largest potential to constrain the sterile neutrino parameter space at the CNGS beam is the 2-3 mixing angle since it is less constrained by present experiments. This is due to its distinctive features such as being the only one that is sensitive to this type of oscillation, and having been designed specifically for it. By taking into account 2-3 oscillations, we point out that the potential of the CNGS beam to look for sterile neutrinos is limited with nominal intensity of the beam, but significantly enhanced with a factor 2 to 10 increase in the neutrino flux. Furthermore, data from both channels allow us to constrain further the four-neutrino model parameter space. Our results hold for any value of, as when oscillations driven by this mass squared difference are averaged.

Treatment of type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome should target not only the cardiometabolic abnormalities, but also the associated liver disorders. In the last decade, it has been shown that metformin, thiazolidinediones, vitamin E, ezetimibe, n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockers, and antiobesity drugs may improve hepatic pathophysiological disorders as well as clinical parameters. Therefore, insulin sensitizers, antioxidative agents, Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 (NPC1L1) inhibitors, RAS blockers, and drugs that target the central nervous system may represent candidate pharmacotherapies for NAFLD and potentially NASH.\n\nEfficacy, safety, and tolerability of long-term treatments (potentially for many years) with these drugs have not been fully established.

Commissioners have sometimes been found to have abused their positions, as in the case of the Santer Commission in 1999, leading to its eventual resignation due to corruption allegations. This was followed by one main case, Commission v Edith Cresson, in which the European Court of Justice held that a Commissioner giving her dentist a job, despite his clear unsuitability, did not necessarily break any law. Conversely, the ECJ's relaxed approach was contrasted with by the findings of an independent Committee of Experts, who determined that a culture of impunity for Commissioners had formed, with few of them appearing to have even the slightest sense of responsibility. To address this, the European Anti-fraud Office was formed in 2012, which eventually led to the resignation of the Maltese Commissioner for Health John Dalli in 2012 over allegations of receiving a €60 million bribe in connection with the Tobacco Products Directive.

{"text": "We consider the type I seesaw model with two right-handed neutrinos and a normal neutrino mass hierarchy. We impose a zero coupling between the right-handed neutrino mainly responsible for the atmospheric neutrino mass and the electron neutrino. We derive a master formula relating the input parameters of the seesaw model to physical neutrino observables. Using the master formula, we search for simple ratios of couplings consistent with current data on neutrino mass and lepton mixing. We discover a minimal predictive example with the right-handed neutrino mainly responsible for the atmospheric neutrino mass having couplings to the electron neutrino proportional to the inverse of the mixing angle between mildly and maximally mixed states. Furthermore, the right-handed neutrino mainly responsible for the solar neutrino mass has couplings to the electron neutrino proportional to another mixing angle or phase, which together with the former phase, gives the link between leptogenesis and CP violation in neutrino oscillation experiments. We show that these patterns of couplings could arise from an @xtmath5 family symmetry model of leptons which predicts all the PMNS parameters in terms of the neutrino mass ratio @xtmath6, corresponding to tri-bimaximal-cabibbo mixing, accurate to one degree. Furthermore, the prediction @xtmath7 could provide the upper bound of the light neutrino mass scale.", "label": "alpaca"}

{"text": "A simplified example of a probabilistic test is the Fermat primality test, which relies on Fermat's Little Theorem, which states that np ≡ n (mod p) for any n if p is a prime number. If we want to test a particular number, b, for primality, we can calculate the value of nb (mod b) randomly for a variety of n's. Unfortunately, there are certain composite numbers (the Carmichael numbers) which, when tested by the Fermat Identity, will yield a valid result even though they are not prime. As a result, this test is unable to distinguish between prime and non-prime numbers. However, more powerful extensions of the Fermat Primality Test, such as the Baillie-PSW, Miller-Rabin, and Solovay-Strassen tests, have failure rates when applied to a composite number.", "label": "alpaca"}

Although I was filled with a sense of shame to be from the same country as them, the fake American accents was the first indicator that things were to go spectacularly wrong. Upon further review, it became apparent that the luxury cruise ship was in fact an old car ferry, decorated with a few of the multi-colored flags stolen from a used car lot. The majority of the cast appeared to be from the long-running New Zealand soap opera, Shortland Street. It was as if this movie was dreamt up at a Shortland Street cast Christmas party, the result of too many gins, and possibly salmonella.

{"text": "The common marmoset ( Callithrix jacchus ) is increasingly being utilized as a nonhuman primate model for human diseases, ranging from autoimmune to infectious diseases. To fully exploit these models, meaningful comparison to the human host response is necessary. Commercially available reagents, primarily targeted to human cells, were utilized to assess the phenotype and activation status of key immune cell types and cytokines in naive and infected animals. Single cell suspensions of blood, spleen, and lung were examined. Generally, the phenotype of cells was comparable between humans and marmosets, with approximately 63% of all lymphocytes in the blood of marmosets being T cells, 25% B cells, and 12% NK cells. The percentage of neutrophils in marmoset blood were more similar to human values than mouse values.\n                 Comparing the activation status of cells following experimental systemic or inhalational infection revealed different trends in different tissues, most obvious in cell types active in the innate immune response. This work significantly enhances the ability to understand the immune response in these animals and fortifies their use as models of infectious diseases.", "label": "alpaca"}

{"text": "Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) accounts for about 15% of adult leukemias and, in patients with the disease, laboratory abnormalities may be the first sign of it detected. Since 2001, the introduction of tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy has transformed CML into a chronic illness for most diagnosed individuals. Primary care physicians are often the first to recognize a new case of CML and may be the first to detect disease progression or adverse effects of therapy. This article provides an overview of the clinical presentation, diagnostic approach, and treatment considerations of CML.  \n                \n                CML is a type of cancer that affects the white blood cells. It often affects the elderly and the disease is characterized by excessive production of white blood cells that are abnormal in structure and function. The disease is divided into two stages: chronic and accelerated. In the chronic stage, 40% of patients are asymptomatic and initial diagnosis is made through laboratory abnormalities. In the accelerated stage, symptoms such as fever, night sweats and fatigue may occur. \n                \n                CML is usually managed by specialized hematologists, but primary care physicians may be the first to recognize a new diagnosis or detect disease progression or adverse effects of therapy. Therefore, it is important for primary care physicians to be familiar with CML and its treatment. The treatment of CML includes various drugs such as imatinib (Gleevec), nilotinib (Tasigna) and dasatinib (Sprycel). While these drugs have revolutionized the management of CML and have greatly enhanced the prognosis of the patients, some may experience side effects that require additional treatment or even hospitalization. Therefore, it is important to monitor for any adverse effects of the treatment and adjust medication accordingly. \n                \n                In conclusion, CML is a form of cancer that is both chronic and treatable. Primary care physicians play an important role in the diagnosis and treatment of the disease and should be familiar with its clinical presentation, diagnostic approach and treatment considerations. With the proper management, CML is now a chronic disease for the majority of patients.", "label": "alpaca"}

{"text": "We have measured the magnetic susceptibility of amorphous thin films biased with an electrical current using anisotropic coils. We tested the symmetry of the vortex response by changing the relative orientation between the bias current and the susceptibility coils. We found a region in the DC current-temperature phase diagram where the dynamic vortex structures behave anisotropically. In this region, the shielding capability of the superconducting currents measured by the susceptibility coils is less effective along the direction of vortex motion compared to the transverse direction. This anisotropic response is found in the same region where the peak effect in the critical current is developed. On rising temperature, this anisotropy is gradually recovered. \n\nPresent Address:\nDepartamento de Fsica, Instituto de Fsica Aplicada, Universidad Nacional de San Luis, CONICET, Ejrcito de los Andes 950, San Luis, Argentina.\nPresent Address:\nDepartamento de Fsica, Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales, Universidad Nacional de Buenos Aires, Autnoma City of Buenos Aires, Argentina.", "label": "alpaca"}

{"text": "The UK Government is consulting on plans to reduce the tolls for the Severn Crossing by more than half in 2018, when the bridges are set to vest in public ownership. Labour MP Jessica Morden argued that the tolls were an \"unfair tax\" on commuters and businesses in her Newport East constituency, while Transport Minister John Hayes stated that a balance should be found between revenue for the government and user contributions. Leading the debate, Ms Morden argued that the Severn Crossing is a key link connecting Wales with the rest of the UK and that the tolls imposed are an unfair burden on her constituents. She also noted that some of her constituents have had to turn down job offers in Bristol due to the high cost of the toll. Ceredigion Liberal Democrat MP Mark Williams argued that the tolls are an example of double taxation and that Wales has already contributed its fair share of revenue to UK infrastructure through taxes. Montgomeryshire MP Glyn Davies echoed this statement, arguing that an agreement should be reached between the UK government and Welsh Assembly. Newport West MP Paul Flynn suggested that a similar scenario could be applied when making decisions regarding the future of the Severn Crossing- the UK government should consult the Welsh Assembly before making any definitive decisions. Finally, Mr Hayes stated that the consultation process is underway and no predetermined conclusions have been reached yet. He also acknowledged the unanimous view of the Welsh Assembly that the toll should be scrapped, and highlighted the need to strike a balance between the contribution of revenue and user payments. The UK government has proposed that the toll for cars will be reduced to £3 in 2018, an amount that Mr Hayes believes is designed to reflect the cost of running the bridges. He asserted that this offer will be welcomed by many.", "label": "alpaca"}

{"text": "Type 2 diabetes is associated with significant morbidity and mortality due to complications related to cardiovascular, nervous, and renal issues. Attempts to cure diabetes using islet transplantation have been successful in providing a source of insulin-secreting cells, but donor scarcity, graft rejection, the need for continued immune suppression, and exhaustion of the donor cell pool prompted the search for a more sustained source of insulin-secreting cells. Stem cell therapy is a promising alternative for islet transplantation in Type 2 diabetic patients who fail to control hyperglycemia even with insulin injection. Autologous stem cell transplantation may provide the best outcome for those patients, as autologous cells are readily available and do not require prolonged hospital stays or sustained immunotoxic therapy. Among autologous adult stem cells, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been applied with varying degrees of success in both animal models and in clinical trials. This review will focus on the advantages of MSCs over other types of stem cells and the possible mechanisms by which MSCs transplant restores normoglycemia in Type 2 diabetic patients. Sources of MSCs including autologous cells from diabetic patients and the use of various differentiation protocols in relation to best transplant outcome will be discussed.", "label": "alpaca"}

We are then plunged into what appears to be a low-budget production, with character introductions happening slowly but surely. We get to know the typical American teens who have been introduced with more detail than usual. By the time the schlitz hits the fan, we know each of the characters and either like or hate them according to their distinct personalities. It is a gradual uphill set-up, similar to climbing a tall roller coaster. Thankfully, the action kicks in and the old school horror ensues. Steve Johnson's make-up effects are awesome and equal in quality to much bigger budgeted films. The humor is sometimes cheesy, but nonetheless effective in delivering a pure 80s horror vibe. The scares are jolting, and the suspenseful set-ups keep you on the edge of your seat. Kevin Tenney's direction is impressive, truly delivering his best movie ever. It is definitely worth checking out for true horror fans, as it pairs well with the 1999 remake of House on the Haunted Hill.

{"text": "To understand the role of local sublattice imbalance in the low energy spectra of quantum antiferromagnets, we studied a quantum nearest-neighbor Heisenberg anti-ferromagnet on a coordination-3 Cayley tree. We performed many-body calculations using an implementation of the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) technique for generic tree graphs. We discovered that the bond-centered Cayley tree has a quasi-degenerate set of low-lying tower of states and an \"anomalous\" singlet-triplet finite size gap scaling. To understand the construction of the first excited state from the many-body ground state, we considered a wavefunction ansatz given by the single mode approximation (SMA), which yields a high overlap with the DMRG wavefunction. Observing the ground state entanglement spectrum leads us to a picture of the low energy degrees of freedom being \"giant spins\" arising out of sublattice imbalance, which helps us analytically understand the scaling of the finite size spin gap. Moreover, the Schwinger boson mean field theory has been generalized to non-uniform lattices, and ground states have been found which are spatially inhomogeneous in the mean field parameters.", "label": "alpaca"}
{"text": "We calculate Curie temperatures and study the stability of ferromagnetism in diluted magnetic materials, taking as a model for the exchange between magnetic impurities a damped Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction and a short-range term representing the effects of spin and thermal fluctuations as well as geometric disorder. To properly include effects of spin and thermal fluctuations as well as geometric disorder, we solve the effective Heisenberg Hamiltonian by means of a recently developed semi-analytical approach. This approach, “self-consistent local random phase approximation” (SC-LRPA), is explained. We show that previous mean-field treatments, which have been widely used in the literature, largely overestimate both the Curie temperatures and the stability of ferromagnetism as a function of carrier density. The discrepancy when compared to the current approach was that effects of frustration in RKKY oscillations had been strongly underestimated by such simple mean-field theories. We argue that the use, as is frequent, of a weakly disordered RKKY exchange to model ferromagnetism in diluted III-V systems is inconsistent with the observation of ferromagnetism over a wide region of itinerant carrier densities. This may be puzzling when compared to the apparent success of calculations based on ab initio estimates of the coupling; we propose a resolution to this issue by taking RKKY-like interactions between resonant states close to the Fermi level.", "label": "alpaca"}
{"text": "The Yuan dynasty saw a vibrant exchange of cultures and influences. Chinese culture in particular benefitted from the Mongols’ extensive contacts with the West, which resulted in the development of drama and the novel, as well as increased use of the written vernacular.

This unity was further strengthened by the Mongols’ contacts with the peoples and cultures in the rest of their vast empire.\n\nThe Mongols also introduced Buddhism to China, which had a great influence on the Yuan government. This was further increased by the contacts between the dynasty and its ally and subordinate in Persia, the Ilkhanate, which helped promote cultural exchange.

{"text": "We model the underdoped cuprates by fermions moving in a background of local antiferromagnetic order which fluctuates in orientation but not in magnitude, resulting in a \"topological\" order that survives. The normal state is described as a fractionalized fermi liquid (FL*) with electron-like quasiparticles coupled to the fractionalized excitations of the fluctuating antiferromagnet. These electronic quasiparticles reside near pocket Fermi surfaces with total area equal to the dopant density, centered away from the magnetic Brillouin zone boundary. Violations of the conventional Luttinger theorem are linked to a “species doubling” of these quasiparticles. We describe phenomenological theories of the pairing of these quasiparticles and show that a large class of mean-field theories generically displays a nodal-anti-nodal \"dichotomy\": the interplay of local antiferromagnetism and pairing leads to a small gap near the nodes of the d-wave pairing along the Brillouin zone diagonals, and a large gap in the anti-nodal region.", "label": "alpaca"}

{"text": "During the mass movements of high school education from 1910 to 1940, there was an increase in skilled workers, leading to a decrease in the price of skilled labor. High school education during this period was designed to equip students with the necessary skill sets to perform work. Presently, it differs from the current high school education, which is seen as a stepping-stone to acquire college and advanced degrees. This decrease in wages resulted in a period of compression and diminished inequality between skilled and unskilled workers. Education is tremendously important for the growth of the economy, however, gender inequality in education also influences economic development. Lagerlof and Galor assert that gender inequality in education could lead to lower economic growth, perpetuating gender inequality and trapping the poor in poverty. This large gap in male and female education may be an indication of backwardness, hindering economic progress.", "label": "alpaca"}
{"text": "neuropathic pain is difficult to treat and can severely impact quality of life.  The capsaicin 8% patch is a novel option that directly targets the source of peripheral neuropathic pain.  It can provide pain relief for up to 12 weeks in patients with peripheral neuropathic pain.  Treatment with the capsaicin 8% patch follows a clearly defined procedure, but patch application must be carried out by a physician or a health care professional under the supervision of a physician.  However, in our experience, nurses often take the lead role in capsaicin 8% patch application without the involvement of a physician.  We believe that the nurse's key role is of benefit to the patients, as he or she may be better placed, due to time constraints and patient relationships, to support the patient through the application procedure than a physician.  Moreover, a number of frequently prescribed drugs, including botulinum toxin and infliximab, can be administered by health care professionals without the requirement for physician supervision.  Here, we argue that current guidance should be amended to remove the requirement for physician supervision during application of the capsaicin 8% patch.", "label": "alpaca"}

To test this, I will attempt to optimize The Pre-Sequel to the best of my ability and monitor the PhysX indicator in-game while heavy particle and fluid effects are being used. From some Google searches, it appears that people have reported different results depending on what kind of GPU they are using. GPU in my GTX 1080 Classified should be up to the task. Additionally, some people who are monitoring their usage with GPU utility software claim that they are reporting low usage, even when the PhysX effects are intense. Back during the release of the game, Nvidia and Gearbox boasted that PhysX would run great on Borderlands 2 and that we wouldn't be experiencing the same issues seen now with undressed having effects. It's been 5 years since its release and I don't think we'll be getting any help from Nvidia or Gearbox regarding this issue. I will keep you updated on my results.

{"text": "In the past decade, the specialty of emergency medicine has become increasingly popular in low and middle-income countries. To support this growing demand, there is a need for new training programs, pre-hospital systems, emergency department expansions, and policy changes. Unfortunately, however, little is known about the actual distribution of medical emergencies in these settings.\n\nThe \"Encounter\" project aims to fill this gap by conducting an epidemiologic survey across multiple centers in India. The survey will provide scientific data upon which new training programs, infrastructural expansions, and legislative changes can be built.\n\nTo do so, a web-based, user-friendly data entry tool, called Encounter, has been developed. This tool is currently being piloted at a tertiary center in Chennai, India. It will be expanded to 20 participating centers across the private and public sector in rural and urban India. The tool ensures standardization of data collection across the centers by providing a uniform, web-based platform.\n\nThe project collects demographic data on patients, pre-hospital transportation information, chief complaints, vitals, interventions, dispositions, and diagnoses. The first quarter of data collection from the pilot phase has already helped to highlight the epidemiologic differences between local hospitals in Chennai and national averages in the US. This data has proven invaluable in identifying potential flaws in the tool and is being used to design global health triage and transfer guidelines.\n\nThe expansion of the project to multiple centers will provide objective insight into the gaps in healthcare provision at various levels and help design inventories and designs of emergency departments, as well as staff needs and skill requirements. This data will make the development of emergency medicine in India both locally relevant and globally applicable.", "label": "alpaca"}

{"text": "Tumor-infiltrating leukocytes are often induced by the cancer microenvironment to display a protumor, proangiogenic phenotype. This polarization has been described for several myeloid cells, in particular macrophages. Natural killer (NK) cells represent another population of innate immune cells able to infiltrate tumors. The role of NK cells in tumor progression and angiogenesis has not yet been fully investigated. Several studies have shown that tumor-infiltrating NK (here referred to as TINKS) and tumor-associated NK (here referred to as TANKS) are compromised in their ability to lyse tumor cells. Recent data have suggested that they are potentially protumorigenic and can also acquire a proangiogenic phenotype. We review the properties of TINKS and TANKS and compare their activities to that of NK cells endowed with a physiological proangiogenic phenotype, in particular decidual NK cells. We speculate on the potential origins of TINKS and TANKS and on the immune signals involved in their differentiation and polarization. The TINKS and TANKS phenotype has broad implications in the immune response to tumors, ranging from a deficient control of cancer and cancer stem cells to an altered crosstalk with other relevant players of the immune response, such as dendritic cells, to induction of cancer angiogenesis. With this recently acquired knowledge, which has not yet been put into perspective, we point out new potential avenues for therapeutic intervention involving NK cells as a target or an ally in oncology.", "label": "alpaca"}

He was seen as the architect of France's tough foreign policy under President Francois Hollande. It is unclear who will replace him. Reports of an impending reshuffle suggested Fabius's departure may be part of a larger shakeup. During his tenure as foreign minister over the past three years, Fabius led French forces in the battle against militants in Mali and directed air strikes against the Islamic State group in Syria and Iraq. He has also been outspoken in his opposition to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.

{"text": "Utilizing data from the International Center for Diarrhea Disease Research, Bangladesh (ICDDR,B) from 1996 to 2001, we compared the clinical features of diarrhea in patients infected with either A. hydrophila (189 patients; 1.4% of 13,970 patients screened) or P. shigelloides (253 patients). The most common symptom was fever (temperature > 37.8°C), and stools were characterized as watery and containing visible mucus. Dehydration occurred more often in patients with V. parahemolyticus or V. cholerae non-O1 infection. Compared to patients infected with V. parahemolyticus, those infected with A. hydrophila, P. shigelloides or V. cholerae non-O1 had less severe diarrhea, as evidenced by lower stool red blood cell and white blood cell counts and a lower proportion of report of subjective cure at the time of discharge. These findings suggest that A. hydrophila and P. shigelloides produce diarrheal disease that is less severe than that caused by V. parahemolyticus.", "label": "alpaca"}

However, MD simulation box size is usually less than a few nanometers, which is a limiting factor for computational performance. To extend the size of the MD simulation, we developed a hybrid code that combines MD with Binary Collision Approximation (BCA). By using BCA instead of calculating all particles with a high kinetic energy for every step in the MD simulation, considerable computation time is saved.

The legislation could come up for a vote in the U.S. Senate following the Nov. 8 election. \n                   “Today, your health plan tells you, you have mental health insurance coverage, but you often run into so much red tape you can never access it,” Murphy said Monday at a Legislative Office Building press conference. \n                   Murphy added: “Discrimination is still rampant in the healthcare system when it comes to treating people with mental illness.” \n                   The Mental Health Reform Act, which is co-sponsored by eight Republicans and eight Democrats, includes a provision that would clarify what violates the current parity law. It would make it clear which internal mechanisms, like fail first policies, like prior authorization policies, are acceptable under the parity law and which aren’t. \n                   He said requiring pre-authorization for certain treatments or drugs would still be allowed under the legislation, but they can’t be more rigorous than procedures for the treatment of a physical condition. \n                   The weakness of the current parity law is stopping millions of Americans from getting the care that they need, Murphy added. \n                   Dr. Peter Jacoby, chairman of Saint Mary’s emergency department, said there’s a shortage of psychiatric beds at almost all hospitals and a lack of appropriate out-patient resources. \n                   He said one uninsured 13-year-old with autism was stuck in the emergency room for more than 20 days. \n                   Saint Mary’s in Waterbury has 12 psychiatric beds for adults and they are always full. Often there are more patients than available beds, which means many are waiting for hours on stretchers in hallways. \n                   The American College of Emergency Physicians recently released a survey of 1,716 emergency room physicians, which found three out of four see at least one patient — often more — every shift who requires hospitalization for mental illness.

{"text": "A recent study showed that early diagnosis is of the utmost importance in medicine as it can prevent irreversible tissue damage. The unique anatomy of the eye provides an excellent opportunity for non-invasive light based imaging of ocular fundus vasculature. Novel imaging agents that target retinal endothelial molecules have been designed and can detect endothelial injury at the early and reversible stage of adhesion molecule upregulation. This new molecular imaging technology has a great potential to improve medicine by detecting diseases or screening disease in early stages, identifying the extent of disease, selecting patient-specific therapeutic treatments, and measuring the exact effects of treatment. Recent advances in instrumentation, such as endoscopes and microcatheters, suggest that these imaging modalities will soon be translated into clinical use.", "label": "alpaca"}

As the story unfolds in real life and fiction, Sparrow must figure out his connection to the book and how the story will eventually end. \n\n                The Number 23 offers an intriguing premise that is undone by a weak execution. The film just failed on many different levels which is pretty disappointing because it held so much potential. The screenplay was probably the worst part about it. It was filled with silly sequences and laughable dialog that just killed the mood of the movie. It seemed like the screenwriter had a good idea, he just didn't know how to develop it to stretch over a ninety minute running time. The second half of the film was running low on ideas, the twist was pretty obvious and the ending was awful. \n\nJoel Schumacher is responsible for one of the worst movies ever and he did redeem himself a little with Phone Booth and a few other films but The Number 23 reminds me that he's still capable of making a stinker. He has the movie drenched in style but he just can't get a good focus. He moves the film at a clunky and slow pace. He switches from reality to what's actually happening in the book which quickly got annoying. The actual book in the film that's titled \"\"The Number 23\"\" is an awful detective story and the audience gets stuck listening to Carrey narrate it which just bored me to tears. When Carrey is finally done with book, we get stuck watching him run around trying to solve the mystery. At this point, the audience has lost interest and there is no real tension. We impatiently wait for the movie to reach it's horrible ending and unconvincing explanation before celebrating that film has finally finished. \n\nThe acting was mostly average and pretty forgettable. Jim Carrey was clearly just sleepwalking through his performance and he didn't even seem to be trying. He was either completely over the top in some scenes or just very wooden. His narration was a complete bore to listen to and he put no life inside his character. Virginia Madsen did the best she could with a limited role but she needs to pick better scripts. Logan Lerman was pretty bland as was Danny Huston. Overall, The Number 23 was an awful thriller that offered more laughs than suspense or thrills. Rating 3/10.", "label": "alpaca"}

The average number of mushrooms per genet was 1.2 to 2.3, and the percentage of genets that were represented by a single mushroom was 44% to 94%. This variation in the genets of mushrooms in close proximity suggests that the ectomycorrhizal mycelial bodies of S. granulatus propagated sexually by fusing haploid spores derived from the mushrooms' gills with below-ground mycelia. Thus, further investigation into the formation of new genets through spores in ectomycorrhizal fungal colonies is necessary.", "label": "alpaca"}

{"text": "Cystinuria is a rare inherited condition that affects the kidneys and the urinary tract. It results in the formation of stones composed of cystine, a type of protein, instead of the normal minerals found in urine. Symptoms of the disorder are often not seen in childhood, but instead present in adulthood as nephrolithiasis, or kidney stones. The prevalence of cystinuria in the general population is around 12%, while it is as high as 50-75% in some families with a history of the disorder. Our patient was a 37-year-old male who presented to us with concerns of kidney stones. He had no family history of cystinuria, nor any personal history of kidney stones or polycystic kidney disease.\n\nLaboratory tests revealed a serum creatinine level of 1.2 mg/dL and urine cystine crystals on routine microscopy. His urine pH was 7.5 and quantitative analysis of his urine cystine showed a concentration of 1645 mg/day, which is significantly higher than the normal excretion rate of 30 mg/day.\n\nDespite our thorough literature review, we were unable to find any potential genetic connections between cystinuria and other renal diseases, including polycystic kidney disease. Therefore, we can only assume that the occurrence of cystinuria and pkd in the same patient is a coincidental finding.\n\nOur conclusion is that the prevalence of cystinuria in the kidney stones patient is rare but should be considered in the differential diagnosis if no other cause is found. Additionally, if there is a family history of cystinuria, genetic testing should be offered as an option for diagnosing the condition. We have successfully diagnosed this patient with cystinuria and are now treating him with a low-protein diet and other medications to help manage his condition.", "label": "alpaca"}
{"text": "This paper is the second in a series investigating the oscillation properties of relativistic, non-selfgravitating tori orbiting around black holes. Building on the work done in a Schwarzschild background, we consider the axisymmetric oscillations of vertically integrated tori in a Kerr spacetime. The tori are modeled with various non-Keplerian distributions of specific angular momentum and we discuss how the oscillation properties depend on these and on the rotation of the central black hole. First, we perform a local analysis to highlight the relations between acoustic and epicyclic oscillations in a Kerr spacetime and subsequently perform a global eigenmode analysis to compute the axisymmetric eigenvalues. In analogy with what found in a Schwarzschild background, these modes behave as sound waves that are modified by rotation and are globally trapped in the torus. For constant distributions of specific angular momentum, the eigenfrequencies appear in a sequence 2:3:4:... that is essentially independent of the size of the disc and of the black hole rotation. For non-constant distributions of angular momentum, however, the sequence depends on the properties of the disc and on the spin of the black hole becoming harmonic for sufficiently large tori. We also comment on how these results may explain the high frequency quasi-periodic oscillations observed in low-mass X-ray binaries with a black hole candidate and the properties of an equivalent model in Newtonian physics.", "label": "alpaca"}

The incorporation of the spin contribution to the trace formula requires an appropriate variant of the equidistribution principle of long periodic orbits as well as the notion of a skew product of the classical translational and spin dynamics. Provided this skew product is mixing, we show that generically the diagonal approximation of the form factor coincides with the respective predictions from random matrix theory. hpl - brims - 1999 - 6 - september 1999 - ulm - 99/tp/6 + +", "label": "alpaca"}

As for Apanowicz, her acting throughout the episode felt awkward and forced, which could be due to her inexperience. Overall, based on the pilot, I'm really looking forward to seeing where 'Caprica' goes next.", "label": "alpaca"}
{"text": "Laurel & Hardy's roles as chimney sweepers is a surprisingly humorous concept that provides some funny situations and silly antics, mainly due to Stan Laurel as usual. The movie also features a subplot with a nutty professor working on a rejuvenation formula, which sounds absurd but works well within the movie's context. The blending of both storylines is remarkable and leads to a memorable ending. The supporting cast is excellent, with Sam Adams portraying the stereotypical butler and Lucien Littlefield going over-the-top as the professor. The movie is filled with comical timed and constructed sequences, which are predictable but become funny to watch due to their execution. Thus, \"\"Dirty Work\"\" is one of the better Laurel & Hardy shorts and earns an 8/10.", "label": "alpaca"}

{"text": "The Schur relaxation method (SR) and the SR-extension (SR-E) have considerably sped up the computation of the retarded Green's function, particularly in two-dimensional nanoscale devices. In this paper, SR-E is applied to obtain the solution of the Non-Equilibrium Green's Function (NEGF) on three-dimensional nanoscale devices. The operation count for SR-E is analyzed for a cuboid device. When a cubic device is discretized with x math 0 grid points, the state-of-the-art recursive Green's function (RGF) algorithm requires x math 1 operations, whereas SR-E requires x math 2 operations. Operation counts and runtimes are also studied for three-dimensional nanoscale devices of practical interest: a graphene-boron nitride-graphene multilayer system, a silicon nanowire, and a DNA molecule. The numerical experiments indicate that the cost for SR-E is proportional to the solution of one linear system (or one LU factorization) and that the speed-ups over RGF exceed three orders of magnitude when simulating realistic devices such as a graphene-boron nitride-graphene multilayer system with 40,000 atoms.", "label": "alpaca"}

{"text": "Hydrogen absorption in Fe has been studied using first principles density functional theory. Atomistic predictions of equilibrium structures, total energies and diffusion barriers were performed for different concentrations of hydrogen as an interstitial impurity in bcc Fe. Internal strains/stresses upon hydrogen absorption are a crucial factor to understand preferred absorption sites and diffusion. For high concentrations, hydrogen absorbs near the octahedral site, favoring a large tetragonal distortion of the bcc lattice. For low concentrations, hydrogen absorbs near the tetrahedral site, minimizing the elastic energy stored on nearby cells. Diffusion paths depend on the concentration regime as well; hydrogen diffuses about 10 times faster in the distorted bct lattice. External stresses of several GPA modifies barriers by 10%, and diffusion rates by 30%.", "label": "alpaca"}

In July, it was reported to be nearing deals for the three majors to each take a 3%-5% stake in the company, as well as a percentage of future revenue. This was soon followed by a deal with Warner Music Group (including its publishing arm Warner/Chappell) in October.\n\nHowever, greater engagement with the major labels came at a price – more takedowns of content from SoundCloud, including some of the remixes and mash-ups that had fuelled the streaming service's growth. This caused a backlash from DJs and artists, who began to voice their displeasure at their music being removed. In January 2015, SoundCloud co-founder Eric Wahlforss confirmed the launch of a premium subscription tier for the service, but the launch was soon pushed back to 2016.\n\nUniversal Music's growing control over the platform seemed to cause concern within the industry, as there were rumours the label had the ability to directly remove tracks from SoundCloud.

We find that the network's degree of connection varies at all scales, with a higher amplitude as the size of the network grows. Further, this phenomenon can be expressed through a spectrum of graph-theoretical Lyapunov exponents. Additionally, we define an entropy growth rate that describes the amount of information generated along network paths. Surprisingly, this rate of growth is found to coincide with the spectrum of graph-theoretical exponents, yielding a set of Pesin-like identities for the network.", "label": "alpaca"}

{"text": "Based on the Gamma-ray Burst (GRB) event rate at redshifts of @xmath0, which has been assessed by the recently found spectral peak energy-to-luminosity relation from Yonetoku et al., we derive the Star Formation Rate (SFR) for Population III (Pop III) stars in a high-redshift Universe. As a result, we find that Pop III stars could form continuously at @xmath1.\n\n                     Using the derived Pop III SFR, we attempt to estimate the Ultraviolet (UV) photon emission rate at @xmath2 in which redshift range no observational information has been hitherto obtained on ionizing radiation intensity. We find that the UV emissivity at @xmath2 can make a noticeable contribution to the early reionization. The maximal emissivity is higher than the level required to keep ionizing the intergalactic matter at @xmath2. However, if the escape fraction of ionizing photons from Pop III objects is smaller than 10%, then the IGM can be neutralized at some redshift, which may lead to the double reionization. As for the enrichment, the ejection of all metals synthesized in Pop III objects is marginally consistent with the IGM metallicity, although the confinement of metals in Pop III objects can reduce the enrichment significantly.", "label": "alpaca"}
{"text": "... so I knew I was in for a treat when the opening shot of the film showed Keira Knightley walking across a grassy field, her long dark hair billowing in the wind and the sun at her back, clad in a simple gown with a sash around her waist. It's a cliché, but it's a cliché because it's a beautiful image.\n                ... unfortunately, that's where the similarities between the script and the actual film ended.

The humour and wit of the dialogue was almost completely lost, replaced with an overwrought, melodramatic intensity that made the whole thing feel a bit silly and unintentionally comical.\n                ...  and it was as though the entire cast had taken acting lessons from the worst ham in the world.

{"text": "Social media content has grown exponentially in recent years, evolving from simply narrating life events to now actively shaping them. To explore the implications of this shift, we analyzed six different datasets of event-centric resources shared in social media from June 2009 to March 2012. Our findings show that 11% of these resources were lost within a year and 41% were lost after two and a half years. Furthermore, a nearly linear relationship was observed between time of sharing and loss, with a slightly less linear relationship observed between time of sharing and archiving coverage. From this, it can be concluded that after one year, near 11% of the resources shared will be lost, with a loss rate of 0.02% per day thereafter. Therefore, effective digital preservation strategies should be employed to ensure that these resources remain accessible in the long term.", "label": "alpaca"}

{"text": "Crowdfunding - asking lots of people to each donate a small sum of money online - has been around since the 1990s, when fans of cult rock bands got together to fund new albums and tours for their idols. The sites are now used by a vast array of different fundraisers. Currently, £25 might buy you a lamb for an Indian village, de-worming tablets for 500 children, or a ukulele. On former Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg's website, though, it'll buy 1000 A4 leaflets for his election campaign. He is not alone. Sites like GoFundMe, Crowdfunder and Crowdpac are brimming with politicians. Crowdfunder says that in the week since the UK election was called, more than £200,000 was raised for political projects on its site. It is expecting a 50% increase in the number of candidates using crowdfunding compared to 2015. Conservatives in Wirral South, UKIP candidate Phil Eckersley and sitting Labour MPs like Peter Kyle, Maria Eagle and Rachel Reeves are among those turning to the technique. There is nothing new about politicians raising money online - but the snap election has left them very little time to raise money through traditional methods, forcing them to get creative. Lib Dem Stephen Lloyd, who is trying to regain the Eastbourne seat he lost to Conservative Caroline Ansell in 2015, said: “Where you have more time, I have fundraising dinners, I've gone to more quizzes and raffles and tombolas than you could shake a stick at. “I instantly realised I didn't have time to do ten fundraisers over the next month.” The internet offered an answer. He set up a page on his website asking for donations, and shared it on Facebook. Within a week, 551 donors had raised over £16,000. He says the response touched him. “The truth of it is I could almost cry. When I've gone out and asked people, they've stepped up. It makes me feel like I'm part of something.” Businesswoman Gina Miller has crowdfunded over £300,000 to organise tactical voting and support up to 100 candidates opposed to a “hard Brexit”. That's alongside numerous pages for SNP and Green candidates. There's even someone calling themselves “Mr Fish Finger” raising money to stand against Lib Dem leader Tim Farron. Anyone who wants to take part in the election has to stump up a £500 deposit. Green MEP Molly Scott Cato is hoping to become an MP in Bristol West. Both she and her party have crowdfunding pages. “Greens have been using this model for a number of years. To be honest, it wasn't that we preferred it - it was our only choice. We're not a very well-funded party and so candidates needed to get hold of enough funds to put up for the deposit.” But isn't it a bit odd to ask the public to fork out even more for the election? After all, June's poll will cost the taxpayer tens of millions of pounds to administer. Molly Scott Cato disagrees. “It's a democratic approach. It allows everybody to support the party with their money, and later on support it with their vote as well, hopefully. “It's a way of people making obvious their investment in the campaign and their commitment to a Green candidate.” Up and down the country, politicians are turning to you, the public, for help with their campaigning costs. But they need to be careful. The Electoral Commission regulates election spending and political donations. It says candidates must collect enough information from donors to be able to check they are allowed to accept their cash. In a statement, the elections watchdog said: “When crowdfunding, campaigners must only accept donations over a certain value from a permissible source. “For candidates that means donations exceeding £50, for political parties and non-party campaigners it is £500. “Candidates, parties and non-party campaigners can only accept donations from permissible, mainly UK sources. “It's a democratic approach. It allows everybody to support the party with their money, and later on support it with their vote as well, hopefully.” So while it's a bit odd to ask the public to fork out even more for the election, it is a way of showing support for the candidate or party.", "label": "alpaca"}

{"text": "Although Xcite's formalism is extremely useful for understanding the transmission spectra of exoplanets, it does not include the effects of a sharp change in flux with altitude, typically associated with surfaces and optically thick clouds. Recent advances in understanding the effects of refraction in exoplanet transmission spectra have, however, demonstrated that even clear, thick atmospheres have this abrupt change in flux due to a refractive boundary. To account for this, we derive a more widely applicable analytical formalism by including first-order effects from all these surfaces to compute an exoplanet’s effective radius, effective atmospheric thickness, and spectral modulation for an atmosphere with a constant scale height. We show that the effective radius cannot be located below these surfaces and that our formalism matches Xcite’s in the case of a clear atmosphere. Our formalism explains why clouds and refraction reduce the contrast of spectral features, and why refraction decreases the Rayleigh scattering slope as wavelength increases, but also shows that these are common effects of all surfaces. We introduce the concept of a surface cross-section, the minimum mean cross-section that can be observed, as an index to characterize the location of surfaces, and provide a simple method to estimate their effects on the spectral modulation of homogeneous atmospheres. Finally, we devise a numerical recipe that extends our formalism to atmospheres with a non-constant scale height and arbitrary sources of opacity, a potentially necessary step to interpret observations.", "label": "alpaca"}

{"text": "cardiac cachexia is a co-morbidity that can develop in the terminal stages of chronic heart failure, affecting up to 15% of ambulatory patients. Over the last decades, research into cardiac cachexia and alterations in muscle metabolism in heart disease has grown increasingly popular. Studies presented at the European Society of Cardiology's annual meeting in Stockholm in 2010 focused on the effects of exercise training and protein degradation, specifically in the roles of the ubiquitin-proteasome complex and its ubiquitin ligases Murf-1 and MAFBX. \n\nExercise training in patients with heart failure was found to increase maximal oxygen consumption and to reduce Murf-1 expression. Lysosomal muscle degradation does not seem to play a major role in patients with heart failure, but inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α trigger muscle protein degradation. Other studies found that the serum levels of the adipokine adiponectin are elevated in patients with heart failure, and that these levels may be correlated with muscle mass, muscle strength in the arms, or with trunk fat mass.

The fact that the same person was credited as writer and director made me wary of the film's quality, and unfortunately I was right. There were a few moments of interest, such as Judy Tenuta's scene which reminded me of her early comedy routines. However, these were too few and far between to warrant more than two stars; I almost skipped the movie entirely because of the opener's incomprehensible violence. I rewatched it several times to try to piece together what was going on, yet it still made no sense. The \"\"spinning camera\"\" technique was overused and ultimately pointless.

{"text": "We investigate the tuneability of electrostatic coupling between solid state quantum dots as building blocks for quantum bits. Specifically, our analysis is based on two-dimensional electron systems (2DEG) and depletion by top gates. We are interested in whether the coulomb interaction between qubits can be tuned by electrical means through screening effects. The systems under investigation are analyzed numerically, solving the Poisson equation in 3D via relaxation techniques with optimized algorithms for an extended set of boundary conditions. These include an open outer boundary, simulation of 2DEG systems and dielectric boundaries like the surface of a physical sample. \n\nThe results show that for lithographically available feature sizes, the coulomb interaction between the quantum bits is weak in general due to efficient screening in the planar geometry and top gates. Furthermore, while it is not possible to turn off the qubit interaction completely, an effective tunability on the order of 0.X is clearly realizable while maintaining an intact quantum bit structure.", "label": "alpaca"}
{"text": "Last night, I was fortunate enough to attend a screening of The Manson Family at the Chicago Underground Film Festival. I found the movie visually impressive and the soundtrack featured actual samples of Charlie's work, but the narrative was obviously inspired by the Autobiography and the book Helter Skelter, which was directeled catered to the sex drugs and rock 'n roll mind of a man who couldn't even watch his own film without getting up every ten minutes to go get more beer or to shout some sort of Rocky Horroresque call line to the actors on screen.  The film accomplishes little more than warping the public's image of actual events which helped shape the state of America and much of the world today. The cast was very good with the exception of Charlie, who resembled some sort of stoned Dungeons and Dragons enthusiast more than the actual role he was portraying. The descriptions the film gave of him as full of energy, throwing ten things at you and being very physical about it all the while did not match at all the slow, lethargic, and chubby representation that was actually presented.

{"text": "Valerie Hunter Gordon's family said she died on 16 October in Beauly. She created the first \"Paddi\" after having her third child, Nigel, in 1947 and becoming fed-up with washing traditional nappies. The two-part garments were initially made out of old nylon parachutes, tissue wadding and cotton wool. Mrs Hunter Gordon made hundreds of the nappies using a sewing machine at her kitchen table, supplying friends with the product and constantly modifying the design. Her husband, Major Pat Hunter Gordon, was also pressed into helping make the nappies when he returned from fighting in Borneo. Speaking to the BBC in 2015, Mrs Hunter Gordon said she had found washing nappies much too laborious and so began searching for disposables. \"I thought you must be able to buy them - but you couldn't, not anywhere,\" she said. \"It seemed extraordinary that it hadn't been done before. I thought, it's easy, I'll make them. But it wasn't easy. It was quite tricky.\" Everybody who saw them said, Valerie, please would you make one for me? And so I ended up by making about over 600 of them.\n\n                \"I spent my time sitting at my mother's sewing machine, making these wretched things.\"  \n                Paddis replaced absorbent cotton towelling nappies, which had to be washed after each use. \"Everybody wanted to stop washing nappies. Nowadays they seem to want to wash them again - good luck to them,\" Mrs Hunter Gordon said last year. The couple applied for a patent in 1948 and signed an agreement with Robinsons to manufacture the nappies in 1949. The first nappies were modelled by her son, Nigel. Possible names for the product included Valette, Snappy, Napkins, Lavnets and Drypad. The name Paddi was chosen after a meeting between Major Hunter Gordon and a group of senior executive Army officers at The Army Staff College in Surrey, according to the Paddi website. At first, there was resistance to the nappies from doctors, who thought it would harm babies' skin, and a general public not used to throwing things away in the post-war years. However, an article in Lancet written by an Army doctor who used Paddis for his baby helped change medical opinion and they began to be stocked by Boots. They were advertised as \"A really attractive garment, skilfully designed by a Mother, to make the whole-time use of disposable nappies a practical possibility\". The company eventually went into decline in the 1960s, with the arrival of the American brand Pampers. Mrs Hunter Gordon's daughter, Frances Ross, said her mother had been survived by six children, 19 grandchildren and 17 great-grandchildren, with another due in a few months.", "label": "alpaca"}

{"text": "6\n                \n                1\n\nThe administration of dopamine and serotonin precursors, such as tyrosine and 5-HTP, has been used for decades to treat a variety of clinical conditions, including depression, anxiety, insomnia, obesity, and more. Dietary administration of these amino acids is intended to increase levels of dopamine and serotonin within the brain and other organs. Convincing evidence exists that these precursors normally elevate dopamine and serotonin levels within critical brain tissues, although the effects on urinary excretion of neurotransmitters remains largely unknown. This study aimed to more precisely define the influence of both 5-HTP and tyrosine on urinary excretion of serotonin and dopamine in a large human population consuming both 5-HTP and tyrosine. \n\nThe results revealed three distinguishable components to 5-HTP responses--inverse, direct, and no relationships--when compared to urinary serotonin excretion. However, a robust relationship was observed when alterations in 5-HTP dose were compared to alterations in urinary serotonin excretion in individual patients. The response to tyrosine was more consistent, but primarily yielded an unexpected reduction in urinary dopamine excretion. These data indicate that the effects of the precursors on urinary neurotransmitter excretion is far more complex than previously appreciated, and may have implications for understanding the effects of the precursors in other organs.", "label": "alpaca"}

{"text": "The precise origin of short gamma ray bursts, or sGRBs, remains an important unsolved mystery in physics. It has recently been suggested that binary compact object mergers, specifically of a neutron star and a black hole, could be responsible. However, distinguishing between a neutron star and a black hole progenitor system is challenging.\n\n                We suggest that the periodic signal of jet precession could be a potential observational hallmark of sGRBs originating from binaries. We use a semi-analytic approach to quantify the fraction of mixed binaries capable of producing sGRBs, as well as the distributions of precession amplitudes and periods. We find that the difficulty of disrupting a neutron star outside the black hole's event horizon decreases the amplitude of the precessing jet and biases it towards low frequency and amplitude.\n\n                Precession periods of @xmath0 and disk-BH spin misalignments @xmath1 are expected, although sufficiently high viscosity can prevent the accumulation of multiple precession periods during the sGRB. This provides an explanation for the lack of multiple pulses seen in some sGRBs. The precessing jet will naturally cover a larger solid angle in the sky than standard sGRB jets, enhancing the chances for detection in both the prompt emission and the optical afterglow.", "label": "alpaca"}

Additionally, the case of hybrid stars under the influence of strong magnetic fields is considered.

According to our knowledge, no similar studies exist in the literature.\n\nThe study included 86 endometriosis patients who had been diagnosed with stage III-IV endometriosis and had undergone laparoscopic resection surgery for endometrioma. The patients were then divided into two groups: those who had ovarian stimulation with a Long GnRH-a protocol (n=44) and those who had ovarian stimulation with a GnRH-ant protocol (n=42).\n\nThe results indicated that the number of follicles on human chorionic gonadotropin injection day, duration of hyperstimulation, number of retrieved metaphase-II oocytes, and total number of grade 1 embryos were significantly higher in the Long GnRH-a protocol. There were no significant differences in positive pregnancy rates (25% vs. 21.4%; p=0.269) and ongoing pregnancy rates per patient (20.5% vs. 19.1%; p=0.302).\n\nIn conclusion, Long GnRH-a and GnRH-ant protocols present similar IVF outcomes in endometriosis patients who have undergone laparoscopic endometrioma resection surgery. The Long GnRH-a protocol may lead to a higher number of embryos that can be cryopreserved, providing the possibility of additional embryo transfers without having to go through the process of ovarian stimulation again.", "label": "alpaca"}

{"text": "3000 years ago, the Rhine River experienced a period of rapid growth due to increased land clearance during the Bronze Age. This caused a surge in sedimentation and flooding, resulting in the formation of peat beds in the Rhine’s current-day delta. In addition, the river underwent many shifts in course due to avulsions – a process whereby the course of the river is moved to a different location on its floodplain. These natural events were further boosted by human actions such as peat mining for salt and fuel from Roman times onwards. Later, embankments, canals, and groynes were built in an effort to control and direct the course of the river. These efforts are clear indicators of the lasting impact of humans on the Rhine’s current form and function.", "label": "alpaca"}

{"text": "We have obtained mid-infrared spectra of nine CV systems below the 2-3 hour period gap using ISAC on the VLT. We detect the secondary stars in all but one system (WX Hyi). We present the first direct detection of the secondary stars of V2051 Oph, V436 Cen, and determine new spectral classifications for EX Hya, VW Hyi, and Z Cha. We find that the Co band strengths of all but Z Cha appear normal for their spectral types, in contrast to their longer period cousins above the period gap. This brings the total number of CVs and pre-CVs with moderate resolution (R1500) IR spectroscopy to 61 systems: 19 pre-CVs, 31 non-magnetic systems, and 11 magnetic or partially magnetic systems. We discuss the trends seen in the IR abundance patterns thus far and highlight a potential link between anomalous abundances seen in the IR with the / anomaly seen in the UV.

{"text": "newborn infants are extremely vulnerable to infection as they have no prior exposure to microbes and have had no opportunity to build up immunity. Several lines of protection are offered by the mother during pregnancy, as a particular type of antibody, called IgG, is passed from mother to baby via the placenta. This passes on both the antibodies and the baby's mother's specific antibody responses. Breast milk or colostrum also helps protect against bacterial infections by containing antibodies that are implanted into the baby and found in their gut, acting as a form of passive immunity. This type of immunity is borrowed from the mother rather than made by the baby and is usually short-term, lasting from a few days to a few months. In medical contexts, artificial passive immunity can also be provided via antibody-rich serum transferred from one person to another.", "label": "alpaca"}

{"text": "The chemical composition of white dwarf WD1536@xmath1520 suggests that the atmosphere is composed primarily of hydrogen and helium, with a few hundredths of a percent of heavier elements. This is an extraordinary abundance of trace elements, including oxygen and silicon, and a strong depletion in volatile elements like carbon and sulfur—indicating the presence of a peculiar parent body. These results are consistent with an accretion scenario, whereby the atmosphere has been built up by the steady deposition of the disrupted material over a period of several hundred million years. The unusually short diffusion timescale of these elements suggests that the system began accumulating planets at least two to three times more massive than the Sun. Furthermore, the composition of the atmosphere suggests that core-like material was also likely part of the parent body, differentiating from the surrounding mantle. Overall, the heavy element abundances deviate slightly from the expected bulk Earth pattern, suggesting that the deposited material may have been composed of several components. This system thus serves as an excellent example of post-main sequence binary star, providing insight into both the accretion process and the formation of planetary systems.", "label": "alpaca"}

It is a collection of the teachings of the Buddha expressed in clear, pithy verses. These verses were culled from various discourses given by the Buddha in the course of 45 years of his teaching, as he wandered through the valley of the Ganges (Ganga) and the sub-mountain tract of the Himalayas. These verses are often terse, witty and convincing. Whenever similes are used, they are those that are easily understood even by a child, e.g., the cart's wheel, a man's shadow, a deep pool, flowers. Through these verses, the Buddha exhorts one to achieve that greatest of all conquests, the conquest of self; to escape from the evils of passion, hatred and ignorance; and to strive hard to attain freedom from craving and freedom from the round of rebirths. Each verse contains a truth (Dhamma), an exhortation, a piece of advice. \n                Dhammapada Verses \n                Dhammapada verses are often quoted by many in many countries of the world and the book has been translated into many languages.  One of the earliest translations into English was made by Max Muller in 1870. Other translations that followed are those by F.L. Woodward in 1921, by Wagismara and Saunders in 1920, and by A.L. Edmunds (Hymns of the Faith) in 1902. Of the recent translations, that by Narada Mahathera is the most widely known. Dr. Walpola Rahula also has translated some selected verses from the Dhammapada and has given them at the end of his book \"What the Buddha Taught\", revised edition. The Chinese have translated the Dhammapada from Sanskrit. The Chinese version of the Dhammapada was translated into English by Samuel Beal (Texts from the Buddhist Canon known as Dhammapada) in 1878. \n                In Burma, translations have been made into Burmese, mostly in prose, some with paraphrases, explanations and abridgments of stories relating to the verses. In recent years, some books on Dhammapada with both Burmese and English translations, together with Pali verses, have also been published. \n                Verse (21) which begins with \"Appamado amatapadam\" meaning \"Mindfulness is the way to Nibbana, the Deathless,\" is a very important and significant verse. Mindfulness is the most important element in Tranquillity and Insight Meditation. The last exhortation of the Buddha just before he passed away was also to be mindful and to endeavour diligently (to complete the task of attaining freedom from the round of rebirths through Magga and Phala). It is generally accepted that it was on account of this verse on mindfulness that the Emperor Asoka of India and King Anawrahta of Burma became converts to Buddhism. Both kings had helped greatly in the propagation of Buddhism in their respective countries.", "label": "alpaca"}
{"text": "In this paper, we investigate the five-dimensional, anisotropic SU(2) gauge theory on the lattice using Monte Carlo techniques. Our goal is to explore the phase diagram, define the various phases, and determine the critical boundaries. Three phases appear - two of them are continuations of the strong and weak coupling phases of pure 4D SU(2) to non-zero coupling in the fifth transverse direction, and they are separated by a crossover transition. We provide evidence that the phase transition between the 5D Coulombic phase and the weak coupling phase is a second order phase transition. Assuming this result is not altered when increasing the lattice volume, we give a first estimate of the associated critical exponents.
