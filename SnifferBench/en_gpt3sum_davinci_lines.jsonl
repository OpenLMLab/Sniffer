{"text": "In this study, the effects of high-salt on the production of inflammatory mediators by Arpe-19 cells was investigated. Results showed that Nacl had no effect on apoptosis or proliferation, but 40mm significantly induced Il-6 and mcp-1 production. When cultured with Nacl, phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, AKT, and NF-B was increased, as well as an up-regulation of the transcription factors Nfat5 and SGK1. These findings suggest that high-salt promotes Il-6 and mcp-1 production in Arpe-19 cells and is associated with activation of p38 MAPK, AKT, NF-B pathways and Nfat-SGK1 pathways.", "label": "gpt3sum"}
{"text": "This study aimed to find out the prevalence of abnormal spermatozoa and associated functional parameters in clinical semen samples of sub-fertile males with the tobacco chewing habit. A retrospective study of 642 male semen samples was conducted at a tertiary health care center over a period of 3 years. Of the samples, 30.2% of participants were tobacco chewers, separated into groups according to their intensity of chewing (< 10 and 10 packets/day). The results showed that in comparison to the non-chewing group, sperm counts, motility, and normal morphology were significantly affected by tobacco chewing (p = 0.001). Intensive chewing (10 packets/day) also had a significant effect on sperm morphology (p = 0.003). Structural defects in the head and cytoplasmic residues were found to be positively correlated with intensive chewing. The conclusion is that the adverse impacts of tobacco chewing on semen parameters were evident even with mild chewers, but with an intensive practice, phenotypes of sperms were severely affected.", "label": "gpt3sum"}

The Fermi surface of the non-interacting problem was found to be correlated to this behavior.

These results suggest a possible way to create spin triplet superconductivity in doped honeycomb-like materials or ultracold atoms.", "label": "gpt3sum"}

To study it, a simplified version is developed without the most essential term that accounts for nonlinear diffraction. In addition, terms for deviation from the paraxial approximation and for the longitudinal electric - field component in the beam are included. Solutions for stationary beams are obtained using perturbative approach, and stability is tested through simulations. The results show that the nonlinear diffraction has stronger effect on stationary beams than nonparaxiality and longitudinal field, and the numerically generated solitary beams are always stable.", "label": "gpt3sum"}

Results from the numerical solution of the Dyson equation showed that modulating the coupling directed energy to flow into or out of the leads simultaneously, depending on the values of the driving frequency and temperature. A special combination of those values existed where no net energy flowed in or out. When one lead had a higher temperature than the other, net energy flowed out of the warmer lead, and the direction of the energy current flow for the cooler lead depended on the values of the driving frequency and temperature. Finally, transient effects were stronger at higher driving frequencies.", "label": "gpt3sum"}

The defense lawyer read a report which stated that Pistorius was not suffering from a mental disorder at the time of the shooting and that he denies murder, saying he killed her by mistake when fearing there was an intruder in the house. The prosecution claims the Olympic athlete deliberately killed Ms Steenkamp after they had an argument. Two reports have been pitted against each other: one from a psychologist which said that Mr Pistorius showed no signs of an explosive temper, narcissism or abusive behaviour and one from three psychiatrists which concluded that he could distinguish right from wrong. Final defense witness Wayne Derman gave evidence about the athlete's \"exaggerated response\" when in uncomfortable situations and his history of feeling insecure and vulnerable.

{"text": "Gamma Doradus stars (also known as \"Dor stars\") are a type of gravity-mode pulsator of spectral type A or F, and their deep stellar interior offers unique insights into their structure. Using four-year long, high-precision Kepler photometry of 67 Dor stars, fourteen binary systems were discovered. Spectroscopic analysis was used to determine the fundamental parameter values of the single stars and the single-lined binaries. A period spacing pattern was identified in the photometric data for 50 of the stars, 46 of which were either single stars or single-lined binaries. There was a strong correlation found between spectroscopic parameters and the period spacing values, confirming the influence of rotation on Dor-type pulsations as predicted by theory, as well as relations between the dominant g-mode frequency, the longest pulsation period detected in the prograde modes, spectroscopic parameters, and the stellar mass.", "label": "gpt3sum"}

This article simulated an ASDEX Upgrade discharge with the GENE code and compared various fluctuating quantities to experimental measurements. The approach was to first obtain turbulence regime with linear simulations, then match heat fluxes with nonlinear simulations, by varying the ion temperature gradient to fit the experimental error bars. It was found that small changes in this parameter can significantly affect density and temperature fluctuation, making it hard for them to be properly compared in experiments. Comparisons using cross-phases have proven to be more accurate, suggesting that they are better for gyrokinetic simulations vs. experimental validation.", "label": "gpt3sum"}

After selecting 31 ARS that could be observed from their birth phase, three topological types were identified: quasi-@xmath1, writhed and top-to-top. The writhed and top-to-top types exhibited high flare activity, and proposed a magnetic model in which the ARS are connected and united as a single structure. Additionally, the flare activity of @xmath0 ARS was found to be correlated with their sunspot area and magnetic complexity, and a possible scaling law exists between the flare index and the maximum umbral area.", "label": "gpt3sum"}

Specifically, when @xmath0 has large transverse momentum and decays leptonically, this results in large missing energy, making them of particular importance. We show that the left-handed nature of the delicate coupling, combined with dominant quarks in the @xmath1 configuration, leads to large left-handed polarization in both @xmath2 and @xmath3 bosons at large transverse momenta. This polarization remains stable under QCD corrections and affects the leptonic decay of the @xmath4 bosons, producing an asymmetry in the transverse momentum distributions between positrons and electrons, and between neutrinos and antineutrinos (missing transverse energy). Such asymmetry could be an effective tool in differentiating between @xmath0+jets and top quark production (which has a much lesser degree of asymmetry due to C invariance).

The mass-accretion rate, disk mass, and other disk properties of OTS44 have been determined, and it is estimated to be 0.01 solar masses. The results suggest that young, free-floating planets and ultra-cool field dwarfs are low-mass extensions of the stellar population.", "label": "gpt3sum"}

These blue galaxies are composed of normal disk or post-starburst systems. By comparing the colors to HST imaging, the authors propose that blue cluster galaxies are a population of late-type, LSB objects which fade and are destroyed in the cluster tidal field. The mean color of non-star forming objects was compared to SED models and found to agree with single burst models, predicting a mean epoch of galaxy formation at redshift 3.8. This implies that the earliest epoch of galaxy formation was around redshift 5.", "label": "gpt3sum"}

Major elements of the model include differences in temperature, number density, non-thermal velocities, and parallel and perpendicular heat conduction and viscosity. With this model, the paper calculated dispersion relations for the MHD waves and found that the dissipation of those waves is heavily dependent on viscosity. The presence of parallel heat conduction can lead to the group velocity of the waves exceeding the speed of light. This suggests that the MHD waves may be a potential source of observed preferential acceleration and heating of ions, which in turn cause coronal plasma heating.", "label": "gpt3sum"}

The model consists of three spines of hydrogen-bonded peptide units connected by covalent bonds. It is found that the energy spectrum has two kinds of bound states, TVBS-I and TVBS-II. At low temperature, the wave functions span the three spines, while at biological temperature they are confined in a single spine. A third bound state, TVBS-III referring to the trapping of two vibrons on two different spines, is also discussed. Finally, the potential breather-like behavior of two-vibron bound states is explored.", "label": "gpt3sum"}

It is shown that electrons escape in order from high to low energies, beginning later than the start of the Sedov phase at an SNR age of @xmath0, and the maximum energy of runaway electrons is below the knee about @xmath1 due to their energy loss from synchrotron radiation. This implies that the highest energy cosmic ray electrons will be detected by various experiments, like AMS-02, Calet, CTA, and LHAASO, and some have already been detected by H.E.S.S. and MAGIC. Additionally, the paper looks at the spatial distribution of runaway electrons and their radiation spectra around SNRs, suggesting that maximum energy photons around @xmath2 come from electrons caught up by the shock, and inverse Compton scattering by runaway electrons can dominate gamma-ray emission from runaway nuclei and both are detectable by CTA and LHAASO.

His 62% contact rate is the lowest since PITCHF/x started tracking the stat, and puts him in the same category as Ryan Howard, Adam Dunn, and Chris Davis. However, there is some hope as Stanton's contact rate was slightly higher in the second half of 2012 and got back to 27% in 2014 when he had a +6 WAR season. Although Stanton has immense power, it may not be enough to bail him out if he continues to swing and miss this often.", "label": "gpt3sum"}
