{"text": "This study demonstrates a connection between high salt intake and the pathogenesis of autoimmune disease. To analyze this further, research was done on the effect of salt (20 mM and 40 mM NaCl) on Arpe-19 cells. The results found that 40 mM NaCl significantly increased IL-6 and MCP-1 production. As an osmotic stress control, high mannitol had no effect on Arpe-19 cell inflammation mediator secretion. It was also observed that coculture of Arpe-19 cells with NaCl induced increased phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, AKT, and NF-B, as well as upregulation of transcription factors NFAT5 and SGK1. These findings suggest that high salt significantly stimulates IL-6 and MCP-1 production by Arpe-19 cells and is linked with actived pathways like p38 MAPK, AKT, and NF-B, and NFAT-SGK1.", "label": "gpt3re"}
{"text": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence of abnormal spermatozoa and associated functional parameters in the clinical semen samples of sub-fertile males with the tobacco chewing habit. A retrospective study was conducted for a period of three years at an infertility unit of a tertiary healthcare center, analyzing the semen of 642 men, of whom 194 (30.2%) were tobacco chewers classified according to their intensity of chewing (<10 and 10 packets/day). The results showed that 66% of subjects who chewed tobacco were oligozoospermic, 85% asthenozoospermic, and 28% teratozoospermic. Sperm counts, motility, and normal morphology were all significantly affected (p = 0.001) in tobacco chewers compared to those who did not chew. Further, when comparing the intensity of the habit, those who used 10 packets/day had a higher effect on sperm morphology (p = 0.003, OR = 2.7, 95% CI = 1.41–5.08). Structural defects in the head (p = 0.001) and cytoplasmic residues (p = 0.001) were found to be positively correlated with intensive chewing, but no significant changes were observed in anomalies in the mid-piece and tail. The adverse effects of tobacco chewing on semen parameters were evident even in mild chewers; however, with a more intensive practice there were clear detriments in the phenotypes of sperm, mainly head and cytoplasmic residue defects.", "label": "gpt3re"}

{"text": "In the late 20th century, there was a systematic effort to count Hispanics separately in the Census. It is estimated that there are now 48 million Hispanics living in the US, or almost 16% of the population. The growth of this population is largely due to births in the US instead of immigration. In the 1930 Census, a one-time inclusion of a \"Mexican\" race category appeared on the forms. The first real attempt to estimate the size of the Hispanic population was in the 1970 Census, where forms were completed by the residents themselves. This question asked if the person's origin or descent was of Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, Central or South American, or Other Spanish  descent. This question had mixed results, as the total count of 9.1 million given was less than most estimates and many people were mistakenly categorized. This problem was addressed in the 1980 Census, where the question was moved to the short form and the response options were more specific. The result was a count of 14.6 Hispanic people. Despite this, errors were still made, such as people misinterpreting the question and attempting to identify as \"American\" or failing to identify as of Hispanic origin.", "label": "gpt3re"}

Clinical and biochemical assessments and evaluations of adrenal functions were conducted. AI was present in 34.6% of ALD patients, 40% of CLD patients, and 40% of LT patients, with 60% of CLD-2 patients being affected, versus 10% of CLD-1 patients. All patients with CLD had significantly lower basal cortisol, stimulated cortisol and incremental cortisol compared to the controls. AI became more common as CLD severity increased, and was predicted by lower levels of serum protein, albumin, total cholesterol and HDL cholesterol and higher levels of serum bilirubin and INR. Adrenal function was observed to recover following LT. These findings imply that AI is part of the spectrum of acute and chronic liver disease, and that patients affected should be monitored for adrenal dysfunction.", "label": "gpt3re"}

Ognjen Kraus, the leader of the Jewish association, commented that this was a warning to the comparatively new center-right government which began its reign earlier this year. It is well-known that tens of thousands died at this notorious camp, deemed Croatia's \"Auschwitz\", and for this reason ethnic Serbs and anti-fascists have also chosen not to attend the celebration. The Ustashe regime in control of Croatia during the war has been blamed for the deaths of the Jews, Serbs, and Gypsies that suffered under their rule; yet some Croatians refute the accusations, seemingly regarding the Ustashe as their country's founders.

{"text": "In this study, the effect of high salt on the production of inflammatory mediators by ARPE-19 cells was investigated and the possible mechanisms involved were explored. ARPE-19 cells were cultured in DMEM to which extra NaCl had been added (20mM and 40mM). NaCl was found to have no effect on the apoptosis and proliferation of ARPE-19. Additionally, the addition of 40mM NaCl significantly increased IL-6 and MCP-1 production, but had no effect on IL-8 secretion. High mannitol, as an osmotic stress control, did not affect the secretion of inflammatory mediators by ARPE-19 cells, suggesting that the effect is not mediated by osmolarity. The coculture of ARPE-19 cells with NaCl resulted in a significant increase in the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, AKT, and NF-B and an upregulation of the transcription factors NFAT5 and SGK1. The results of this study show that high salt significantly promotes IL-6 and MCP-1 production by ARPE-19 cells and is associated with the activation of the p38 MAPK, AKT, and NF-B pathways and NFAT-SGK1 pathways.", "label": "gpt3re"}

Data showed that the Middle East is an area of high growth for the construction industry and offers higher average wages than the UK, for example. Across all job types, sectors and levels of experience, the average salary for a construction industry professional in the Middle East is £42,090, as opposed to the UK's £26,719. Even for architects with 14+ years of experience, the average salary in the Middle East (£43,389) is slightly higher than the UK's (£40,000). Finally, depending on their trade, certain construction workers in the US/Canada have reported annual incomes of over $100,000.", "label": "gpt3re"}
{"text": "This study investigated the prevalence of Adrenal Insufficiency (AI) in individuals with Acute Liver Disease (ALD), Chronic Liver Disease (CLD) of Child-Pugh stages A or B/C, and Post-Liver Transplantation (LT). Healthy controls were also included (25). Participants underwent clinical, biochemical and hormonal evaluations. Results showed AI in 34.6% of ALD, 40% of CLD and 40% of LT patients. Among CLD patients, 60% of those in Child-Pugh stage B/C had AI versus only 10% of those in stage A. Subjects with impaired liver function had significantly reduced levels of basal cortisol, stimulated cortisol and incremental cortisol compared to the healthy controls. AI was further linked to lower levels of serum protein, serum albumin, total cholesterol and HDL cholesterol, plus higher values of serum bilirubin and INR. Adrenal functions apparently improved following LT. It is concluded that AI is a prevalent phenomenon in the entire spectrum of liver diseases and patients should be assessed for its presence regularly.", "label": "gpt3re"}
{"text": "Ognjen Kraus, president of the Co-ordinating Committee of Jewish Communities, said the absence of approximately 300 individuals from the Jewish association at the official ceremony of Jasenovac - a death camp infamous for the Tens of thousands killed there - was a warning to the new centre-right government. This camp, operated by the Ustashe regime, was responsible for the deaths of Jews, Serbs, and Gypsies. Activists have expressed concerns that some Croations view the Ustashe as their country's founding fathers, overlooking the atrocities committed. This controversy has been ongoing since early January, when ultra-nationalists shouted pro-Nazi slogans at a rally with Deputy Parliamentary Speaker Ivan Tepes present. The same kind of slogan was again chanted during afootball match between Israel and Croatia watched by the Prime Minister Tihomir Oreskovic in March. Out of an estimated 40,000 Croatian Jews, nearly three-quarters were killed by the Ustashe, and Jews now compose less than 1% of the population.", "label": "gpt3re"}
{"text": "In comparison with standard linkage mapping, Linkage Disequilibrium (LD)-mapping, which uses the non-random association between loci in haplotypes, is an effective, high-accuracy mapping tool for complex quantitative traits. The recent advances in the development of unbiased association mapping approaches for plant populations, and their successful application in dissection of basic to intricate attributes in various crop species, signify a surge of the approach as a powerful gene tagging tool for agricultural crops in the generation of plant genomics in the 21st century. The aim of this review is to provide non-expert readers of crop breeding communities with (1) the underlying principle, benefits, and simple description of existing strategies for association mapping with the current progressions for plant populations, and (2) the particulars of some of the pioneering and recent studies on association mapping in various crop species to illustrate the feasibility, success, problems, and future prospects of the efforts in plants. This should be of use to interested readers of the international plant research community as a guideline for fundamental comprehension, selection of the right methods, and its use.", "label": "gpt3re"}

Amidst this formula, I didn't care much for the romantic aspects. Looking back now, I enjoy such movies for their comedic value. It was when I saw the movie, Psycho, that my perspective shifted. I was enraptured as the main character, Janet Leigh, was killed off early in the film.

Dr. Fermín's erratic behaviour, driven by a passion one can't properly understand, also left me bewildered. How many times was there ever a conversation between Mararía? Maybe once? Moreover, Mararía was not a real character at all but a stereotypical presence needed for the movie (in the absence of which a different title might have been necessary). While the best acting came from the comparatively insignificant role of Marcial, the meek yet intellectually challenged drunk, it has to be said that the breathtaking views of the Canary Islands and other pleasing elements presented in the movie were commendable. A strong drama it wasn't, most likely due to its aspirations to be a documentary.", "label": "gpt3re"}

The results showed that the Border Collie's markings segregated as a simple autosomal recessive, with 7 out of 25 of the intercross progeny exhibiting the phenotype. To determine if the genes for the Endothelin B receptor (EDNRB) and C-kit (KIT) were associated with the white spotting patterns, Southern analysis and a microsatellite developed from a bacterial artificial chromosome containing the canine gene were used to identify the polymorphisms between the Newfoundland and Border Collie. The analysis concluded that both EDNRB and KIT genes were excluded as potential causes of the white spotting pattern in at least two of the intercross progeny, suggesting that although these genes are involved in white spotting patterns in other animals, they do not appear to be responsible for the pattern in the Border Collie breed of dogs.", "label": "gpt3re"}

{"text": "A cell-based, high-throughput screen to identify small molecular weight stimulators of the innate immune system revealed substituted pyrimido[5,4-b]indoles as potent NF-B activators. The most potent hit compound selectively stimulated Toll-like Receptor 4 (TLR4) in both human and mouse cells. Synthetic modifications of the pyrimido[5,4-b]indole scaffold at the carboxamide, n-3, and n-5 positions showed different TLR4-dependent production of NF-B and type I interferon associated cytokines, IL-6 and Interferon-induced Protein 10 (IP-10) respectively. Particularly, a subset of compounds featuring phenyl and substituted phenyl carboxamides induced lower IL-6 release while maintaining higher IP-10 production, leaning towards the type I interferon pathway. Substitution at n-5 with short alkyl substituents decreased the cytotoxicity of the leading hit compound. Computational studies suggested that active compounds bound mainly to MD-2 in the TLR4/MD-2 complex. These small molecules, which stimulate innate immune cells with minimal toxicity, could possibly be utilized as adjuvants or immune modulators.", "label": "gpt3re"}

Clarke had a history of fainting and dizziness which he lied about to doctors and the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA), and Sheriff Beckett stated that the crash might have been avoided had he been honest about his medical issues. The sheriff further determined that Glasgow City Council and other local authorities, doctors and GPs, and the DVLA should take additional steps in the future to help reduce such losses of life. He laid out eight \"reasonable precautions\" which could have prevented the crash and nineteen recommendations that could be made to lower the risk of recurrence. Witnesses from the inquiry testified that Clarke had prior fainting episodes while driving, when he was employed by First Glasgow in 2010, and that First Glasgow had not provided an accurate reference to Glasgow City Council, which could have prevented the crash. Evidence was questioned about what, if anything, the other crewman on the lorry could have done, as well as if emergency braking systems should be installed on all bin lorry fleets. Finally, Sheriff Beckett said harsher penalties should be considered for those who fail to disclose health issues to the DVLA, and the Secretary of State for Transport should consult on changes to the driver licensing system.

Michael Gaffikin (James Warwick), a former British Army paratrooper and local dentist, has a relationship with local artist and cartographer Fiona Patterson (Celia Imrie) that attracts some suspicion from the protective community. But the serenity is broken when Gaffikin finds the headless body of a brutally slain woman while out golfing. After delivering the remains to local GP, Dr Goudry, a search by Insp Inskip (Maurice Roëves) of the island police station for a killer and a missing local woman proves fruitless. At dinner with Gaffikin that night, Fiona realises that the dead woman might be Sheila Anderson, a winter resident on the island. A search of Dove Cottage, her home, reveals the missing remains of her body and the murder scene. But why was her torso dragged over a mile into the woods? Suspicion turns to Colonel Howard (Jonathan Newth), the sole outsider on the island and the last to have seen Anderson alive when they arrived on the last ferry. Goudry requests dental expertise from Gaffikin to examine the victim's body and the results point to either a human or animal attacker with tremendous strength. A sheep is found mutilated, then a Canadian ornithologist is slain, and a heavy fog rolling in cuts the island off from the mainland. Reports of UFO's, sighting of a camouflaged soldier and finding of a strange craft on the beach further the confusion. Based on the novel Child of the Vodyanoi by David Wiltshire and adapted by Dr Who and Blake's 7 scriptwriter Robert Holmes and directed by Douglas Camfield, The Nightmare Man offers solid character development, an authentic atmosphere and is held together with a focus on believability.

{"text": "Many species are hermaphrodites, meaning the same single animal can produce both eggs and sperm, meaning it can fertilize its own egg without needing a partner. In some hermaphrodites, eggs and sperm can develop at the same time, while others require both to mature separately. Usually, fertilization takes place externally, with the exception of the platyctenids whose eggs are fertilized internally and remain in the parents' body until hatching. As they grow, the young, which are typically planktonic, resemble their adult form, with the beroids being the exception as their young are miniature versions with large mouths and no tentacles. Similarly, in the platyctenids the juvenile form persists until near-adult size, at which point it rapidly metamorphoses into the adult body type. Surprisingly, some species are capable of reproducing prior to achieving adult size and shape. The combination of hermaphroditism and early reproduction allows for small populations to rapidly increase in size.", "label": "gpt3re"}

{"text": "It is strikingly clear that the budgeting of a government (the chancellor by law) differs greatly from that of our own personal budgets. The chancellor makes an annual presentation of their plans to raise funds (generally through taxes and borrowing) and where these funds will be allocated; some occasions including future years commitments. Unlike households, the government does not have to pay off all of its debts in one go, and can roll them over for years instead. This is backed up by the structure of some types of taxation such as Excise Duty and Bank Levy, which are often charged on a flat rate as opposed to a percentage rate like VAT. Similarly, Income Tax also varies depending on income bracket and thresholds - a higher rate being charged as someone moves into a higher tax bracket. It is notable that whilst Bank Levy and Income Tax can bring growth to an economy, they can also act as brakes if employed too liberally, in that people will have less money to spend. The Structural Deficit its concept is used to describe the budget deficit without the instrumental role of the economy to be taken into account. The implementation of tax credits (Working Tax Credit and Child Tax Credit) is designed to make it enticing to come off unemployment benefits, even if it comes at the cost of subsidizing low wages. Lastly, the Triple-Lock Scheme ensures that pensioners will see their pensions increase, even with low inflation rates.", "label": "gpt3re"}

{"text": "The Department of Health has invested £100m to sequence the entire genetic code of 100,000 patients with cancer and rare diseases in order to further accelerate the development of personalised medicine. In order to do this, experts are collating all available data of the 350,000 new cancer diagnoses per year in the UK through a National Register. This includes data from patients in every acute NHS trust and 11 million historic records. This will eventually help to track how each sub-type of cancer responds to treatment, informing the treatments of future patients. Jem Rashbass, director of disease registration at Public Health England, explains that this will drastically change the way that cancer is diagnosed and treated. Furthermore, the service will be exchanged with Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, who have their own individual registers. Emma Greenwood, Cancer Research UK's head of policy development, said that this is great news, as it gives us all the UK's cancer information all in one place, making the highest quality care more attainable. It is also set to speed up research and help to bring personalised cancer medicines to the future.", "label": "gpt3re"}
{"text": "In this paper, we introduce a new model for second order non-stationary random functions as a convolution of an orthogonal random measure and a spatially varying random weighting function. This model generalizes the common convolution model, which involves a non-random weighting function, to a much more general and flexible class of non-stationary covariance functions. We further develop a procedurein this single realization and local stationarity framework that infers the parameters from a local variogram estimator, with a weighted local least-squares approach combined with kernel smoothing methods. We also compare its performance on two real datasets (soil and rainfall data), and show that it outperforms the stationary model according to several criteria. Conditional simulations can also be carried out within this non-stationary framework.", "label": "gpt3re"}

{"text": "This study aimed to evaluate the conversion degree (DC) of a low-shrinkage composite resin (Venus Diamond) in the 12 hours following initial photoactivation. Attenuated Total Reflection (ATR) FT-IR spectroscopy was used to monitor the conversion degree over 12 hours. 1 or 2 mm samples were cured using a LED lamp, and ATR spectra were obtained from the bottom surface of each sample at the beginning of the post-curing period (p=0), after 30 minutes (p=0.5) and at the end of the period (p=12). An ANOVA test calculated the interactions between thickness (t), irradiation time (i) and post-curing (p) on the DC. Results indicated that all first-order interactions were significant, with the exception of the t-p interaction, and the shift from p=0 to p=0.5 had a greater influence on the DC than the shift from p=0.5 to p=12. It was concluded that increased irradiation time may be used to obtain a high conversion degree (DC) with low-shrinkage nano-hybrid composite resin, particularly with 2 mm composite layers.", "label": "gpt3re"}

Nuclear-powered ships and submarines rely on either a steam turbine directly for their primary propulsion, with generators providing supplemental power, or turbo-electric transmission, in which the steam stimulates a turbo generator set with power coming from electric motors. Only a few steam turbine railroad locomotives have been made. Some non-condensing direct-drive locomotives were successful for long-distance freight transport in Sweden and for express passenger work in Britain, but similar models were not made again. In the USA, there were some more advanced designs with electric transmission that were tested, but they were not repeated due to the fact that steam turbines were not appropriate for the railroad atmosphere, and the steam locomotives could not displace the classic reciprocating steam unit as electric and diesel traction has done.", "label": "gpt3re"}

Fourteen organisations, including NHS England, have signed an agreement to make sure conversion therapy is not given to patients, and to provide more training for staff to better support people who are lesbian, gay, or bisexual.  Despite the fact that referrals to conversion services are relatively rare, there is evidence which suggests some GPs, counsellors, and psychotherapists have made them. The Memorandum of Understanding, which has been set up to stop the offering of conversion therapy, has made it clear that NHS England does not endorse or support these services. In addition, Amber Dowell from the UK Council of Psychotherapy revealed the agreement was “really important” and stressed people should be able to explore their sexuality in an environment that is free of judgement. Despite no official figures of how many people attempt conversion therapy each year, the Department of Health is aware it still happens. One previous patient, Louise, shared her experience of receiving treatment for being gay and told that the sessions were attended by many married women without the knowledge of their partners or children. “Brad” also attempted it, but realised it was not changing his feelings so he stopped. Mike Davidson believes the service should still be allowed and provides support to those who “want to change their sexual feelings” from Northern Ireland.

{"text": "Formation of plant virus membrane-associated replication factories necessitates the linkage of viral replication proteins and viral RNA with intracellular membranes, inclusion of host factors, and alteration of membranes in order to assemble novel structures that facilitate replication. Several viruses contain integral membrane proteins that are responsible for fixing the replication complexes to the membranes. These hydrophobic proteins contain either transmembrane domains or amphipathic helices, both of which are instrumental in connecting the proteins to the membrane and reshaping its structure. Plant virus integral membrane proteins that have generated the most attention — such as Co-pro and NTB proteins in comoviruses, as well as X2 and NTB proteins in cognate nepoviruses — are related to Picornavirus 2B, 2C, and 3A membrane proteins. A range of research paradigms — among them identification of membrane association domains and analysis of membrane topology — have been used to characterize these proteins. Furthermore, observations are also available that suggest these proteins are capable of inducing proliferation of membranes, transforming structure and stability of intracellular membranes, and influencing the degree of symptoms exhibited by infected plants.

The correlations for total calcium (0.71), sodium (0.68), and urea (0.64) were fair. Since Falcor and Konelab produced values that are closely related, albumin, aspartate aminotransferase, creatine kinase, phosphate, potassium, total bilirubin, creatinine, and total proteins results can be used interchangeably without needing correction factor computations. However, alkaline phosphatase, total calcium, and sodium results of Falcor should not be used interchangeably and should instead be interpreted using reference intervals established from the Falcor analyser due to the differences in methodologies.", "label": "gpt3re"}

{"text": "As a big fan of surrealist art, I wasn't too impressed by this film by Bunuel, which also had some ideas from Dali. Bunuel harbored a lifelong grievance against the Catholic church and appeared to have a tendency to try and spite it using slightly immature tactics. This film was most certainly one of those instances and its climax - which had nothing to do with the rest of the movie - served as one last subtle jibe. A number of scholars have theorized that the main theme is the result of sexual oppression from the church and society however, this is expressed in a very convoluted manner. The protagonist appears to be a rather loathsome character, seemingly more like a bratty teen than anything else, as evidenced by his fondness of kicking puppies, knocking down the blind in the streets, and having odd sexual fantasies involving billboard advertisements. Consequently, I think it is more likely that Bunuel had some personal demons and chose to blame the Catholics for them. Although there were a few points where the outrageous, surrealist themes were showcased, the majority of the movie involves forgettable self-indulgence. Unfortunately, Bunuel maintained such a point of view throughout his body of work such as Viridiana and The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie.

The article has sparked a negative reaction in Jordan due to the king's numerous insults to other Middle Eastern leaders, his own spies, his tribal supporters and his siblings while trying to promote modernity and democracy. His Majesty appears to be a monarch alone and alienated, with only the Israelis, the Jordanian army and his wife, Queen Rania, seemingly immune to his criticism. A longtime friend of the palace commented that “refreshingly candid would be one way to describe his remarks.\" After his comments caused a stir, the palace released a statement claiming many fallacies were taken out of context and that the king admires and respects “just about all the people he appeared to have insulted.\" The palace added that His Majesty thought the article would show how he's taking the country forward on the path of economic and political reform. Jeffrey Goldberg told us that the interviews with the king were recorded and conducted with the presence of the Court's chief of staff and chief spokesperson.

{"text": "In our examination of the mid-infrared (7.522μm) spectra of AGB stars in the globular cluster 47 Tucanae, conducted with the Spitzer telescope, we observed significant dust features from a variety of different types. Through comparison of the characteristics of the dust spectra with the location of the stars in a logP-[1] diagram, we saw that dust mineralogy and evolutionary stage of AGB stars are connected. A 13μm feature was seen in spectra of AGB stars of lower luminosity, while the more luminous stars showed a broader feature at 11.5μm. The spectra of the most luminous stars were dominated by the amorphous silicate bending vibration centered at 9.7μm. For the AGB stars in 47 Tucanae, we determined that early on the AGB dust is primarily made of Al- and Fe oxides, while later on, as the stars evolve, amorphous silicates become an increasingly dominant element.", "label": "gpt3re"}

{"text": "Making decisions for the latest wave of MLS soccer-specific stadiums has been focused on creating intimate atmospheres. Intimate not in the sense of quiet but rather raucous, bringing thousands of fans as close to each other and the pitch as possible. Looking at Orlando City Stadium, we've seen this same trend being replicated for the stadiums of Minnesota United, D.C. United, and Los Angeles Football Club that will be opening next year. Hamilton, the lead designer for Populous, comments that MLS owners are now expanding upon the typical 18,000-seat design, with many building closer to 25,000. This increase in capacity has also meant an increase in features, such as canopies which creates a signature European-style design that helps to bounce the crowd noise back to the pitch. The seating bowl has been designed to be tight and continuous, making the audience experience more intense for the 90 minutes of the match. The concept of having an \"intense yet intimate\" atmosphere is one that Gensler Sports, designers of the upcoming Banc of California Stadium for LAFC, support.

{"text": "Killer T cells are a sub-type of T cells that are responsible for identifying and destroying cells infected with viruses, as well as cells that are dysfunctional or damaged. Each Killer T cell is able to recognize an antigen, which is made possible through its T cell receptor (TCR), which binds to the complex between an MHC Class I receptor and the antigen. In addition, the T cell's co-receptor, CD8, helps facilitate this recognition. When an activated T cell comes into contact with a cell bearing the MHC I receptor and the antigen, it releases cytotoxins and granulysin, a protease, which cause the target cell to undergo apoptosis. The activation of T cells is strictly regulated and requires either a strong MHC/antigen activation signal or additional activation signals given by helper T cells.

{"text": "This study aimed to retrospectively evaluate dosimetric parameters expressed as biological effective dose (BED) in relation to the outcome of 171 patients with cervical cancer stages IB-IIB. These patients were treated with various treatment approaches, including radiotherapy with or without surgery, between January 1989 and December 1991. The outcomes of the patients were evaluated at five years. The disease-specific survival rate was 87%, 75%, 54% for stages IB, IIA, and IIB, respectively, while the overall survival rate was 84%, 68%, and 43% for the same stages. Patients who were solely treated with radiotherapy had a local control rate of 77%, which was comparable to those of radiotherapy and surgery patients (78%). Late complications were observed in 25 patients (15%). For patients treated with radiotherapy and surgery, there were no correlations between BED10 and outcomes. However, in patients treated with radiotherapy only, a higher BED10 was associated with a higher overall survival (p = 0.0075). The dose-response parameters calculated from BED were D50 = 85.2 Gy10 and the normalized-to-total dose slope of the dose-response curve = 1.62 for survival, and D50 = 61.6 Gy10 and = 0.92, respectively, for local control.

Forty-one poliomyelitic patients scheduled for lower limb corrective surgeries were divided into two groups (scoliotic spine, n=20; normal spine, n=21), and each patient was injected with 2 ml of bupivacaine intrathecally in the sitting position. Statistical analysis of demographic data was carried out and analyzed, as was the extent of block, spread, regression of sensory block, and motor block. Results from the study showed that there were statistically significant differences in the bilateral spread of sensory block between the two groups, but no significant difference in the maximum extent of sensory block and time taken for two-segment regression of sensory block. There was also no significant difference in the time taken to reach complete motor block nor complete recovery of motor block.

MC-LR was also found to directly trigger the phosphorylation of NF-B and upregulate the expression of cell adhesion molecules (ICAM-1 and VCAM-1) in HUVECs. Therefore, the present findings demonstrate that MC-LR induces a vascular inflammatory process mediated by oxidative stress, NF-B activation, and enhanced expression of cell adhesion molecules, potentially leading to damage of the blood vessels. This may add to the understanding of the serious water pollution and public health hazard posed by MCs to humans and animals.", "label": "gpt3re"}

Their plan to thwart their father's union includes directing the gold-digger (Barnes) to the wealthy Count (Milland). However, the Count is a full-time drunk (Auer) that the girls mistakenly believe to be an actual aristocrat. Durbin's performance as a youngster shines in this sweet, yet not overly sugary, film. Her portrayal and her natural singing voice are key elements in the enjoyable storytelling. Additionally, Charles Winninger as the father who, initially, does not want his children around until he meets them, Milland's youthful presence at the start of his career, and Binnie Barnes' depiction of the gold-digger are a few of the memorable performances. Furthermore, this lovely film fills audiences with warmth and is the catalyst for a sequel and stardom for Deanna Durbin, as she has the final shot in the movie.\"", "label": "gpt3re"}

The proposed SCR deal would pass responsibility for major roads, public transport, skills for employment, and other major projects to the mayor. Following this, Sir Steve announced that the SCR would submit its consultation responses to Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government Sajid Javid; during this time Sir Steve stated that the the elected mayor was still not a confirmed deal, and that the decision to go ahead will only be made if it is the best solution for the SCR's residents, and that other options were still to be considered. Moreover, the SCR also wanted clarity on whether Chesterfield and Bassetlaw, two of the nine local authorities of the SCR, should become constituent members and take part in future mayoral elections.

{"text": "The risks of Occupational Asthma (OA) caused by antibiotics are uncertain. Four new cases have been identified and a systematic review of the literature has been conducted. The patients were employed in the manufacture of antibiotics and provocation testing (SPT) was used to confirm a diagnosis. Penicillins were implicated in three of the cases, and erythromycin in the fourth, which had not previously been reported as a potential cause of OA. In two cases there was evidence pointing to an immunological cause, and SPT revealed late asthmatic reactions and increased bronchial hyperresponsiveness. A total of 36 case reports have been published, 26 of which cite penicillins or cephalosporins as a potential cause. Seven workplace-based surveys have reported a prevalence of 58%. The conclusions drawn from the current study are that OA in antibiotic manufacturers may be more common than is generally recognised. The mechanism of OA remains unclear, immunological tests are of uncertain value, and potential cases require confirmation with SPT.

{"text": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the potential toxicity of antiglaucoma medications to corneal endothelial cells (CECs) using an in vitro toxicity assay. Primary cultures of human CECs from eye bank specimens were generated, and then exposed to test solutions including 0.5% timoptol, preservative-free 0.5% timolol maleate, 1% trusopt, preservative-free 1% dorzolamide, travatan, travatan z, xalatan, and benzalkonium chloride (BAK) for 10, 30 or 60 minutes, or 48 hours. Cell viability was examined using a WST-1 assay, and the toxicity was compared using the Cell Viability Score (CVS). The results showed that hCEC viabilities decreased in response to the 10-fold dilutions of test solutions for 48 hours, except for preservative-free 1% dorzolamide which resulted in a viability of 72.0% at a dilution of 100-fold. Moreover, the presence of BAK significantly reduced the toxicity of latanoprost. Based on the CVS, travatan z and preservative-free timolol maleate had the highest viabilities and the lowest toxicities. In conclusion, antiglaucoma eye drops generally produced hCEC toxicity which appeared to be dependent on the presence of BAK. Dilution of antiglaucoma solutions resulted in lower hCEC toxicity, indicating that damage to CECs due to antiglaucoma medications may occur only in rare cases. The CVS was useful for comparison of the toxicity of the drugs.", "label": "gpt3re"}

The six fruits tested were grapes, Asian pears, guavas, golden kiwifruit, lychees, and bananas. Glycemic index values were calculated according to the standard glycemic index testing protocol and published formulas. In type 2 diabetes, the GI values for grapes, Asian pears, guavas, golden kiwifruit, lychees, and bananas were 49.0 ± 4.5, 25.9 ± 2.9, 32.8 ± 5.2, 47.0 ± 6.5, 60.0 ± 8.0, and 41.3 ± 3.5, respectively. In healthy subjects, the GI values were 49.1 ± 7.3, 18.0 ± 5.4, 31.1 ± 5.1, 47.3 ± 12.1, 47.9 ± 6.8, and 35.1 ± 5.6, respectively. There was no significant difference in GI values between healthy and type 2 diabetes subjects and also not for peak incremental indices when comparing healthy subjects and type 2 diabetes subjects.

{"text": "Abstract: We report a case study on a 67-year-old man with a rare and severe atrial-esophageal fistula (AEF) following radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA) of atrial fibrillation (AF) which was treated with esophageal stenting and surgical repair. After surgery, the patient developed out-of-control sepsis and infectious shock, resulting in death. A literature review of 57 articles on AEF from 2003 to 2015 on the PubMed database was conducted and the most common symptoms were determined to be fever, rigor, sepsis and neurologic symptoms. Chest computed tomography and contrast-enhanced CT were found to be the most reliable noninvasive diagnostic methods due to their high sensitivity. It is concluded that timely definition diagnosis with early primary surgical repair may prevent fatalities. Conservative treatment or esophageal stenting alone may not be effective for AEF patients.", "label": "gpt3re"}

Investigators have accused companies of paying bribes to get sought-after Petrobras contracts, leading to numerous indictments for those involved with Brazil's governing Workers' Party. President Dilma Rousseff, who formerly chaired Petrobras, has been cleared of any wrongdoing. Odebrecht is one of Brazil's most notable construction firms, and its works are seen in many countries throughout the continent, like Angola and Mozambique. It is being examined in light of the extensive investigations related to Petrobras, after documents connecting corruption with Petrobras were released. Prior to these events, critics had raised suspicions that Odebrecht was profiting too greatly from its connections with the Brazilian government. Brazil's BNDES has since then released information about how much money was given to Odebrecht for infrastructure projects in Cuba and Angola, and the construction conglomerate is now the center of one of Brazil's most expensive corruption scandals. The operation's police spokesman stated that the arrests had made it clear that no one, no matter how powerful, could escape their attention, which could be seen from the $16 billion (Â£10bn) that the Petrobras scandal has already cost, and the additional $2 billion (Â£1.2bn) allotted to the corrupt executives and firms.", "label": "gpt3re"}
{"text": "We investigated the association between hypertension and co-morbid type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2 DM) and white matter integrity in 33 hypertensive and 29 normotensive middle-aged and elderly adults. Hypertensive participants had higher prevalence of periventricular white matter (WM) lesions and lower diffusion tensor imaging-based WM microstructural integrity than normotensive participants. 22 hypertensive participants with T2 DM had more widespread WM pathology than the 11 with no T2 DM. Furthermore, both hypertension and T2 DM were related to decreased retinal arterial diameter. Exploratory analysis showed that the associations between retinal arteriolar narrowing and widespread subclinical losses in WM microstructural integrity, primarily in the frontal lobe, were independent of age and body mass index. The findings suggest that the frontal lobe is more vulnerable to microvascular damage when both hypertension and T2 DM are present.", "label": "gpt3re"}

This composite spectrum fits the CXB spectrum from 0.1 to 1 keV and if the spectra of quasars steepen at around 100 keV, it can nearly perfectly fit the CXB in the broader energy range of 0.1 to 10 keV. Furthermore, this power law source population results in a significant discrepancy between the number counts in different energy bands, with the source number density being approximately three times greater at 10 keV than at the corresponding flux at 1 keV, which is in line with the differences between HEAO A-1/Ginga and Einstein/ROSAT measurements.", "label": "gpt3re"}

{"text": "Despite his dream of becoming a doctor, Bowerman could not afford medical school. He started his career as a running coach at both Franklin High School and Medford High School. After a tour of duty in Italy during World War II, Bowerman was recruited to replace Hayward at the University of Oregon. He implemented the use of \"easy\" and \"hard\" workout days, along with the use of film to analyze performance; producing 24 NCAA individual champions, four national team titles and coaching the US track and field team in the 1972 Olympics. It was then that Bowerman sought to create lighter apparel and shoe designs, with the help of a local shoemaker. Utilizing materials such as latex, leather, glue and his wife's waffle iron, Nike was founded through a joint venture between Bowerman and Phil Knight. This led to pioneering a new type of lightweight running shoe, revolutionizing the field of sportswear. Additionally, \"Jogging,\" published in 1967, further aided in the spread of running in the US. Bowerman was officially inducted into the National Distance Running Hall of Fame in 2002.", "label": "gpt3re"}
{"text": "Beginning in the late 19th century, the steam engine was improved with the addition of steam turbines. Steam turbines are much more efficient than reciprocating piston type steam engines for output greater than several hundred horsepower, and possess fewer moving parts. Furthermore, they directly offer rotational power, instead of using a connecting rod system or similar method. During the early 20th century, steam turbines almost completely superseded reciprocating engines in electricity generating stations due to their reliability, high speed, and assured rotation. This remains true - 90% of the electric power in the United States is created by steam turbines, fueled by a variety of heat sources. Steam turbines were heavily utilized to propel large vessels throughout the majority of the 20th century.", "label": "gpt3re"}

After conducting semi-structured interviews based on the DSM IV-TR criteria and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) which contains 21 items each scored from 0 to 3, with a total score of 0 to 63, the prevalence rate and risk factors of depression were determined. The most frequent risk factors for HCV infection were intravenous drug abuse (59.3%), unsafe sexual contact (30.5%) and previous imprisonment (25.4%). The prevalence rate of depression in the HCV group was significantly higher at 55.9% (95% CI: 42.99% - 68.87%) than the corresponding rate of the control group of 17.7% (95% CI: 8.49% - 28.79%) (p<0.001).

By utilizing unbinned likelihood, it is possible to optimize information usage in both the data and the models, thus increasing the sensitivity. We show that even when the model fails to accurately describe the true background behavior, it is still possible to regain the asymptotic behavior of the test statistic.

Hopefully, in the near future we will witness a crock galloping off into a golden sunset or a monkey flushing said crocky down the toilet of an international space station for midgets to enjoy an exploitative waltz.

This is partly due to a lack of understanding of the scientific method among some of the reporters. I have come across some of the most hyped up news articles in recent years, and this article seeks to explain how some of the reporting went wrong. For instance, one article suggested Housework was linked to a lower risk of breast cancer; whilst correlational, the two variables do not necessarily mean one is causing the other. Other exaggerations included 'Recession causes increase in teen dating violence',Sexual Lyrics prompting teens to have sex, 'Facebook causing one in five divorces in the U.S' and 'higher beer prices cutting gonorrhea rates'. Even the suggestion that 'the pill can lead to a long marriage of bad sex' was an error as the original study found that women who take the pill are merely less sexually satisfied not that it leads to a bad marriage.", "label": "gpt3re"}

My aim with this thread is to help those considering getting a JDM V7, and to serve as a resource for people such as myself who have already taken the plunge into the EJ motor swap. I have had experience with many B-series swaps, but this is the first time I am attempting this, so I'm in the same boat as plenty of people who are just starting out. I believe the best way to learn something is to dive right in and get your hands dirty. As I work through the steps to complete this swap, I am hoping that those with prior experience will be able to provide me and others with tips so we can all be successful. I decided to go with the JDM swap as a result of finding out that only one of my cylinders had a compression of 30psi. Reconstructing the EJ205 would have cost about the same amount as the whole swap does, so after analyzing the EJ207 Owners thread (which was 187 pages at the time), I concluded that going ahead with the JDM engine was the best solution. I hope to have a dependable daily driver with a bit of extra power in the end!", "label": "gpt3re"}

{"text": "By utilizing the limited-phase quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) technique, we conducted an extensive research into the pairing correlations of the ground state of the doped Kane-Mele-Hubbard model on a honeycomb lattice. Our analysis reveals that pairing correlations with @xmath0 symmetry are more dominant close to half filling while pairing correlations with @xmath1 symmetry take over as hole doping decreases the system to below three-quarters filling. These behaviors can be linked to the topology of the Fermi surfaces of the non-interacting problem. Additionally, we observe that the effective pairing correlation is greatly augmented as the interaction is increased and that such superconducting correlations are resilient against changing the spin-orbit coupling strength. Our numerical results could suggest a way of achieving spin triplet superconductivity in doped honeycomb-like materials or ultracold atoms in optical traps.", "label": "gpt3re"}

{"text": "Patients with Diabetes Mellitus (DM) have an increased risk for cardiovascular-related morbidity and mortality compared to healthy individuals. It has been shown that the postprandial metabolic state is associated with atherogenesis in DM patients. The STOP-NIDDM trial found that treatment with an α‐glucosidase inhibitor (α-GI) in those with impaired glucose tolerance not only decreased the rate of conversion to Type 2 DM (T2DM), but was also associated with a reduction in risk of cardiovascular events. This suggests the significance of targeting postprandial hyperglycemia in early stages of T2DM. Glinides, which are short-acting insulin secretagogues, restore postprandial early insulin secretion and reduce the postprandial glucose spike. Additionally, α-GIs delay the digestion of carbohydrates and polysaccharides in the small intestine, reducing postprandial hyperglycemia and insulin secretion. Both of these drugs are effective in managing T2DM and impaired glucose tolerance; so, a combination of the two could be a promising therapy. The combination of Mitiglinide and Voglibose has been shown to reduce postprandial insulin secretion and diurnal glycemic changes in T2DM patients, which is suitable for strict postprandial glycemic control. This has been evaluated for its effects on postprandial plasma glucose and safety.", "label": "gpt3re"}

{"text": "Evidence is mounting that the same reward circuits in the brain responsible for sustaining drug addictions may also be responsible for the hedonic cravings and hunger pangs typically seen in overweight and obese individuals. A polymorphism that reduces the sensitivity of the D2 dopamine receptor has been suggested as a cause of addictive behaviours such as drinking, drug abuse and binge eating. Examining how this polymorphism interacts with other potential obesity gene markers, such as polymorphisms in the leptin receptor gene and the opiomelanocortin gene, is critical. Leptin is a pro-inflammatory cytokine as well as a long-term signal in the regulation of body fat. Upper body obesity also triggers systemic inflammation through several different cytokines including leptin, which can have an effect on many organs in the body, such as the brain. The link between obesity-mediated low-grade inflammation, which then contributes to the onset of several health issues from type 2 diabetes to cardiac disease and depression, has made people realize how this inflammation of the brain due to obesity may lead to addictive behaviour which then results in a cycle that's tough to break and not just limited to food but for alcohol, drugs, and gambling as well.

Newer models developed from emission measure distributions by Macpherson & Jordan (1999) are consistent with observations of other transition region lines, though they fail to reproduce the observed helium resonance line intensities. The possibility of non-Maxwellian electron distributions in the transition region leading to increased collisional excitation rates in the helium lines is also studied, with enhancements of the helium resonance line intensities found, but with line ratios inconsistent with observations.

Unfortunately, this was not a great choice - it was a bit of a dud, despite featuring both Jimmy Stewart and Charles Coburn, both great actors. The story follows a young lawyer, John Manson, played by Stewart, who gets married to Jane, played by Lombard, within an hour of meeting her. The film tries to make use of the classic \"marry in haste, repent at leisure\" trope, as well as a series of other clichés, like worsened financial status, trouble with John's live-in mother, John's diminished status at the office, unexpected baby son, baby sickness, heroic flight to get serum, and finally John's acceptance at the law firm. There wasn't much comedy and the drama felt lacklustre, but the acting of the four main characters was quite good. The movie was released in 1939, at the beginning of the WWII era in the United States, so the writers likely tried to promote good American values, like family, relationships, perseverance, etc., which explain why they used Jimmy Stewart and Carol Lombard.

Tara Brown, 24, was killed in hospital after her ex-partner, who allegedly rammed her car off the road and brutally attacked her with a brick, was refused help when she sought it. Karina Lock, 49, meanwhile, was killed in front of astonished bystanders by her estranged husband. Another man was arrested for driving his partner's car off the road, pursuing her down the street with a machete, although she managed to survive. These occurrences have sparked immense grief and remorse, prompting the Peak Inter-Governmental Forum, the Council of Australian Governments, to create a scheme in which domestic violence Court orders from one jurisdiction are recognized in another. This would help women and protect them from the violence following them through different states. In Australia, statistics show that one woman is killed each week due to intimate partner violence.", "label": "gpt3re"}
{"text": "I have a difficult time believing that director Leos Carax intended the quoted English subtitle in his rejection letter to the protagonist to be self-referential and tongue-in-cheek: his choice in actors and the overall performance of the movie all appear to be quite earnest. While David Lynch, Alejandro Jodorowski, Krysztof Kieslowski and David Cronenberg are all renowned for integrating surrealism into their stories in élan and style, Leos Carax's film, Pola X, fails to bring anything novel or engaging to the table at all. The pacing is erratic and choppy, often foregoing continuity; superfluous characters appear sporadically; the performances are overly dramatic; the lighting for the sex scene is particularly poor quality; and there are a number of unconnected scenes that have little purpose. Despite this, there are some positive moments that must be recognized - the musical score is excellent, particularly the techno soundtrack in the abandoned facility, and actress Cather Deneuve is still as captivating as ever. In the 21st century, Jean-Pierre Jeunet is one of the few directors in France that can still make a reasonable movie, and Carax's Pola X is not something that should be rated highly; it is unoriginal and vastly below par, and should not be watched with any great expectation.

{"text": "We study two-plus-one-dimensional beams whose transverse size may be equal to or smaller than the carrier wavelength, based on an extended version of the nonlinear Schrödinger equation derived from Maxwell's equations. Since this equation is complicated, we also analyze its simplified version, which retains the most important term, i.e. the term of nonlinear diffraction. The full equation additionally comprises terms derived from a deviation from the paraxial approximation and a longitudinal electric field component of the beam. The full and simplified equations are found to have stationary solitary wave solutions, treating the modifying terms of the nonlinear Schrödinger equation as perturbations. In this approach, a conserved power of the beam is obtained in an explicit form and is found to be strongly affected by nonlinear diffraction, more so than by nonparaxiality and longitudinal field. The stability of the beams is tested by simulating the simplified equation, with initial conditions given by the perturbation theory. The numerically generated solitary beams have been seen to always be stable and never start to collapse, but display periodic internal vibrations that decrease with the increase of the beam power.", "label": "gpt3re"}

{"text": "We utilize the non-equilibrium Green's Function Formalism to study the temporal thermal transport in a linear chain composed of two infinite leads connected by a time-modulated coupling regulated by an external force that can absorb and emit energy. We numerically solve the Dyson equation for the contour-ordered Greens functions to determine the energy flowing out of the leads. The magnitude of the modulated coupling is similar to the interparticle coupling in each lead. When both leads are at the same temperature, our numerical results show that modulating the coupling between the leads can cause energy to flow into or out of the leads simultaneously depending on the driving frequency and temperature values. There is a certain combination of driving frequency and temperature values that results in no net energy entering or leaving the leads, even for a long period of time. When one of the leads is hotter than the other, energy flows out of the warmer lead, whereas the cooler lead's energy current changes direction depending on the driving frequency and temperature. Moreover, higher driving frequencies yield more prominent transient effects.", "label": "gpt3re"}

The results showed that activity of the thoracic extensors at the T9 level when employing thoracolumbar fixation with ADIM, was significantly higher than with only pelvic fixation or pelvic fixation with ADIM during prone trunk extension, whereas for the lumbar extensors at the L3 level, pelvic fixing alone, without ADIM, was significantly higher than pelvic fixing with ADIM or additional thoracolumbar fixation with ADIM during prone trunk extension.

At least three distinct definitions exist in different books and papers, all of which yield the same result in the thermodynamic limit.

We argue that the (@xmath1) definition of chemical potential, which is conventionally found in the grand canonical density operator, is the only valid definition for all finite systems. This is because the grand canonical ensemble is the only one of the standard ensembles (microcanonical, canonical, Gibbs, grand canonical) which is suitable for statistical thermodynamics whenever the chemical potential is physically relevant. Perdew et al. developed the zero-temperature limit of @xmath1 for finite electron systems, which typically include electron-electron interactions. We extend this derivation, and consider the zero-T limit taken after the thermodynamic limit for semiconductors. Shegelski recently found enormous finite size corrections (in macroscopic samples such as 1 @xmath0) for one commonly-used chemical potential definition, which we also discuss.

{"text": "Free movement and trade have been a fundamental part of European development since the Treaty of Rome 1957, and the term \"social market economy\" was introduced into EU law in 2007. According to the theory of comparative advantage, Two countries can both profit from trade despite disparities between their economies. Similarly, regional organisations such as the North American Free Trade Association, the World Trade Organisation, and the EU try to break down restrictions to trade in order to decrease the cost for customers. It was predicted that a free trade area would naturally lead to a customs union and beyond, resulting in complete union acting like a federal government. In reality, however, these stages were combined, so it is uncertain if the \"endgame\" of free trade will be similar to a state. Additionally, free trade can advantageally impact some people like major corporations while simultaneously oppressing the disadvantaged who lack bargaining power in the widening market, making it difficult for laborers, consumers, small businesses, burgeoning sectors, and towns. The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union includes enforcing the free movement of goods (articles 28 to 37) as well as persons, services, and capital (articles 45 to 66). These \"four freedoms\" are sometimes hindered by physical obstacles, technical aspects like various safety, consumer or environmental regulations, or fiscal barriers like various Value Added Tax levels. Nonetheless, EU Treaties should limit free trade in order to favor social objectives like public health, consumer protection, labour rights, fair competition, and environmental advancement.

{"text": "We decided to invest in an R3 and placed it in the middle of our garage, using both sides. Unfortunately, this cut off our pull-up height due to beams and a garage door motor, as well as our Olympic Lifting space. Therefore, we spent a few days doing some math and figured out that there was enough space for two people to lift concurrently on this 30\" version while against the wall, so we purchased it. We put it together with two people and it was much easier that way. It is easy to lift and move around with just two people and it is simple to set up either upright or horizontal. We tested that two people could squat simultaneously and it worked! We were able to both squat inside the rack and outside of the uprights with our loaded bars. There is 18\" of space between plates. We built a platform because our floor was cracked and uneven, so we layered roofing felt (tar paper) and built the platform with 2 layers of 5/8\" OSB and one layer of 3/4\" AC plywood/stall mats, for a total thickness of 2\". We secured it to the platform using twelve 2.5\" x 1/2\" lag bolts with two 1/8\" thick washers per bolt, so the 2.5\" lag bolts go almost all the way through the 2\" platform. In the end, we are very pleased with our R3.", "label": "gpt3re"}

{"text": "After losing its importance at the start of the 20th century as a colonial power and in the field of tropical medicine, Germany sought to secure a new place in international healthcare during the period of decolonisation. In 1956, the beginning of German government developmental aid saw medical academics from West German universities become involved in several countries in Asia, Africa and South America. The selected example to be studied more closely is the support for the National Hygiene Institute in Togo, formerly a German model colony, yet now an ally of the West. The project needed multiple arrangements due to its position between public health and scientific research, development aid and academia, along with West German and West African interests, which had a noted impact on the cooperation between the two countries. In a country such as Togo, where education during colonial rule was neglected, having competent national staff has been a major factor in the success of the project. While routine services became efficient, research demanded more sustained capacity building and did not lead to joint work on equal terms. For West German developmental aid, arrangements with universities were mutually beneficial for government officials and medical specialists. It did not need to create permanent placements for the consulting experts it required, it was able to find qualified German personnel to work abroad and it profited from the academic status of its consultants. Medical scientists had the opportunity to secure jobs and research possibilities for their postgraduates, received grants for foreign doctoral students, acquired additional expertise and enjoyed international prestige. Furthermore, most West German medical academics in the 1960s were not keen on independence from foreign politics.", "label": "gpt3re"}

{"text": "This film is a must-see! Director Alain Chabat (who also stars as Caesar) has successfully encapsulated the spirit of the French comic books \"Adventures of Asterix,\" and fashioned a fantastically modern and witty comedy that is an homage to animated films. The humor and jests (both visual and verbal) are so abundant that it might require more than one viewing to catch them all in between laughing. The only downside is that non-French viewers (or those who don't speak the language) might not understand all the inside jokes. There are too many conversations that can't be translated, and situations directly related to the comics and French culture, making the fun lessened. Nonetheless, this movie is still absolutely worth the watch for its stunning visuals, remarkable stunts, energizing music, zany atmosphere, and top-notch acting.

Delegates of the event will be residing in the swanky hotels nearby. This is the third of its kind in the past six years, with its agenda focusing primarily on security, governance and the economy. Although much progress has been made, Somalia is still described as \"chronically unstable and ungoverned\" and is affected by Islamist militants, piracy and famine. There has been a recent reduction in piracy, and Al-Shabab has been mostly removed from major towns with help from the US, African Union and Somali forces. However, the terrorists still occupy and attack many places, and the recent electoral process led to the election of the current president Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed, also known as Farmajo. Although not mentioned at the conference, there is a severe water shortage which is currently Somalia’s worst drought in decades. This shortage has led to 1.4 million acutely malnourished children, 275,000 of which are in life-threatening conditions. Most are unable to go to school and help support the economy of the country, making it even more unstable. While humans have suffered, the livestock sector is equally affected; in Somaliland, 80% of the livestock have died. Supposedly caused by the famine, US troops were sent to Somalia in 1991 which ended in a withdrawal in 1993 following the destruction of two US Black Hawks.

{"text": "Under Article 56 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), people who offer services for a fee, particularly in a professional or commercial capacity, are entitled to the \"freedom to provide services\". For example, in Van Binsbergen v Bestuur van de Bedrijfvereniging voor de Metaalnijverheid, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) ruled that the freedom to provide services applied to a Dutch lawyer who wanted to continue advising a client in a social security case in Belgium, despite a Dutch law that stated that only people established in the Netherlands could give legal advice. The CJEU found that this prohibition was likely unjustified and that having an address in the member state would be enough to ensure good administration of justice.Secondary education is not covered by Article 56 as it is usually funded by the state, while higher education does fall within its scope. Health care, meanwhile, is generally considered to be a service. In Geraets-Smits v Stichting Ziekenfonds, the CJEU ruled that there could be circumstances where, even if health care is not provided immediately in the state, authorities may refuse to reimburse costs for medical services received abroad. This must also fall in line with international medical science and take into account the individual patientbased circcumstances.The Article also does not cover activities that are considered illegal, as in Josemans v Burgemeester van Maastricht, which held that the Netherlands' regulation of cannabis consumption was outside of its scope altogether. Any activities that do fall within its scope may be restricted according to Article 52 and certain conditions justified by the CJEU. This is demonstrated in cases such as Alps Investment BV v Minister van Financiën, which held that a Dutch prohibition on cold calling customers was appropriate to prevent undeseirable developments in securities trading, while Omega Spielhallen GmbH v Bonn held that human dignity was a justified restriction on freedom to provide services.Lastly, Article 16 of the Services Directive is set out to codify the various justifications developed by the CJEU. An example of this can be seen in Liga Portuguesa de Futebol v Santa Casa da Misericórdia de Lisboa, in which the CJEU determined that a state monopoly on gambling and penalties for firms selling internet gambling services were justified to prevent fraud and gambling where public opinion was highly divided. The ban was also held to be proportionate in order to effectively tackle problems connected to internet fraud.", "label": "gpt3re"}

Fifty patients treated with statins and reporting muscle pain were recruited and divided into a Coenzyme Q10 (Q10) group and a placebo group. Results showed that the intensity of muscle pain, measured based on the Pain Severity Score (PSS) and Pain Interference Score (PIS), in the Q10 group was significantly reduced (p<0.001). Coenzyme Q10 supplementation caused lower interference of statin-related muscular symptoms with daily activities, as measured by PSS and PIS, in the Q10 group (33.1% and 40.3%, respectively) compared to the placebo group (both p<0.05).

In addition, the effects of the Coulomb interaction can be easily distinguished from the nucleon-nucleon interaction. Our results, both qualitatively and quantitatively, confirm the strong dependence of the symmetry energy on various isovector properties for the studied nuclei, allowing us to set possible constraints between the slope and value of the symmetry energy at the saturation density.

Larry and Owen enter into a pact to get rid of each other's hated family members, and the film follows their journey as two unlikely protagonists. Crystal and DeVito both excel, and the film is certainly never boring, as it uses innovative editing techniques and darkly comic moments to great effect. 'Throw Momma From the Train' takes risks in its content and characters and it pays off, providing laughs, entertainment and some surprises with its tight runtime. It may not be for everyone, but this film delivers what it promises.", "label": "gpt3re"}
{"text": "Due to the rare occurrence of Hemangiopericytoma (HPC) and its controversial histological classification, misdiagnosis of the condition and a challenging treatment are often seen. It is tough to tell the difference between HPCs and meningiomas based on clinical features and radiological findings. This is a story of a 30-year-old man, with the diagnosis of a meningioma clinically and radiologically, though histological examination revealed it was an anaplastic HPC. Symptoms of the patient included worsening headache and blurring vision for a period of three months. Clinical exams showed a right homonymous hemianopia with reduced visual acuity bi-laterally, and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) presented a multilobulated and heterogenous extraaxial lesion attaching to the occipital falx, measuring 9.0 cm Axial, 5.5 cm Width and 5.8 cm Central Core. An occipital craniotomy followed by a subtotal tumor excision was done due to profuse bleeding intraoperatively. Histopathology confirmed anaplastic HPC (WHO Grade 3). Clarifying the distinction between HPCs and meningiomas is of great importance. Obtaining an accurate diagnosis pre-operatively can be difficult, but it should be focused on paying attention to the mushroom-like multilobulated shape, prominent internal signal voids, relatively narrow dural attachment, and lytic destruction without calcifications as useful clues that help differentiate HPCs from meningiomas.", "label": "gpt3re"}

We present a 41-year-old woman who was seropositive for Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) and who displayed uncommon repeat cycles of Brain Lesions associated with relapsing-remitting Syndrome. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans over a 9 year period showed similar patterns akin to Multiple Sclerosis.

She plead guilty in February and prosecutors pushed their recommendation for her sentence to 20 years due to new facts revealed about the case. Previously, the defence had argued that Pettway had provided White with a supportive and loving home for 23 years and she was known by Nejdra Nance in Connecticut and then Georgia. However, it was found that Pettway had committed five crimes with White in her care and had used cocaine from 1983 to 2005, which was also stated in the report from the probation department. Joy White, Carlina's mother, told probation officers that her daughter also stated that Pettway had hit her with a shoe and left an imprint on her face. In Pettway's letter before the sentencing hearing, she expressed her remorse and stated that she wished she had sought professional help after her failed pregnancies. She also noted the pain she had caused and said that because of her actions, many lives had been hurt. It was through her plea bargain that she revealed the confession of how she had taken Carlina from Harlem Hospital by train from Bridgeport, Connecticut.

He asked participants to join a study about their perception and purported it as such; however, it was in actuality a study on conformity and the power of social pressure. Participants were presented with images like the one below and asked to choose the bar of equal length from the set of bars on the right. Asch made sure that all but one participant was a conspirator and had previously directed them to select the wrong answer. To Asch's surprise, a high percentage of participants conformed to the wrong answers.

As a result of seeing the normality of consuming animal products, people question their beliefs and doubt themselves regardless of being a vegetarian or vegan. J.M.

{"text": "We examined the anti-inflammatory capabilities of three types of lipid emulsions with parenteral administration: olive oil-based Clinoleic, fish oil-based Smoflipid, and soybean oil-based Lipofundin. We observed leukocyte recruitment and survival in a murine model of LPS-induced systemic inflammation, and analyzed expression of leukocyte and endothelial adhesion molecules. Clinoleic and Smoflipid both profoundly inhibited leukocyte adhesion compared to Lipofundin during LPS-induced inflammation of the murine cremaster muscle. While Smoflipid and Lipofundin had no effect on survival in the murine model of lethal endotoxemia, Clinoleic effectively blocked leukocyte recruitment, and increased survival. Flow chamber experiments and analysis of adhesion molecule expression suggest that both endothelial and leukocyte driven mechanisms contribute to the anti-inflammatory effects of Clinoleic. Our findings substantiate that Clinoleic has superior anti-inflammatory qualities compared to Smoflipid and Lipofundin, even during systemic inflammation, thus warranting further investigation into the potential use of parenteral lipids as an anti-inflammatory strategy in critically ill patients.", "label": "gpt3re"}

{"text": " Recent experiments using Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) have investigated systems involving Kondo impurities in Quantum Corrals created on Copper or Noble Metal surfaces. To determine the conditions under which the Kondo effect could be projected to a remote location (the Quantum Mirage), the two-dimensional one-particle Schrödinger Equation in a hard wall corral without impurity was solved. For modelling a soft circular corralas, the equation had to be solved under the potential @xmath0,@xmath1 being the distance to the center of the corral and @xmath2 its radius. The Green's function of electron surface states @xmath3 for @xmath4 then had to be expanded as a discrete sum of contributions from single poles at energy @xmath5. The imaginary part @xmath6 being the half-width of the resonance produced by the soft confining potential and turned out to be an simple increasing function of @xmath7. In the presence of an impurity, the Anderson Model was solved at arbitrary temperatures using the expression for @xmath3 and perturbation theory up to second order in the Coulomb repulsion @xmath8. The resulting change in the differential conductance @xmath9 was calculated as a function of voltage and space in circular and elliptical corrals, taking into account the conditions of recent experiments. The main results of the analysis were recreated and the role of direct hybridization between the impurity and the bulk, the confinement potential, the size of the corral, and the temperature on the intensity of the mirage were all explored.

{"text": "It appears that the spatial and chromatic properties of human red and green color vision are best suited for identifying fruit in foliage within arm's reach. However, evidence suggests that the ability to spot fruit from a distance was more critical in evolutionary history. To test this idea, we compared the performance of individuals with normal trichromacy, dichromacy, and anomalous trichromacy in a visual search task involving finding fruit in a bush at various viewing distances of 1, 4, 8, or 12 meters. It was found that the greatest advantage of normal trichromacy over the other forms of color deficiency was when the viewing distance was the largest. This suggests that spotting fruit from a distance was a greater selective advantage than picking fruit at arm's reach during the evolution of human color vision.", "label": "gpt3re"}
{"text": "It has been demonstrated that through the evolution of the difference between the spectral indices for inflaton perturbations, we can gain insight into the scale dependence of the ratio of tensor to scalar amplitudes, @xmath0, and how the scalar field potential is involved. For example, @xmath0 may converge to a constant during inflation, though the dynamics may be different from the power law model. Situations have been found where the resulting perturbation spectra are in agreement with CMB and LSS data, but @xmath0 doesnt remain constant during inflation. The inflaton potential representing @xmath0 determined by an nth order polynomial of the e-fold number can be expressed in an equation which can be solved quadratically. The first order case explicitly shows that through the observable discrepancy between the spectral indices at a chosen pivot scale, information about the linear term of the polynomial can be gained. The solutions manifest features which go beyond the exponential form associated with power law inflation, and can match with the data from modern day observations.", "label": "gpt3re"}

Carroll had his lawyer draw up a deed transferring the land from himself to himself and his wife in November of 1986, and the deed was recorded in the Little Compton Land Evidence Records. They planned to subdivide the land into house lots and began the process by clearing brush and trimming trees around the boundary lines, with the help of a surveyor who placed six granite boundary markers, as well as metal rods, around the properties. They received approval from the town to subdivide, but with the condition of widening Amy Hart Path, which they did by bringing gravel and stone in to improve the road's integrity and Installing drainage pipes. When Francis Carroll passed away in 1989, Karen Carroll succeeded in getting Amy Hart Path declared a public road, which enabled her to bring utilities to the plots and put up utility poles. She then put up no trespassing signs and hired a Realtor who got purchase and sales agreements with security deposits on all four lots. One buyer, Christian LeBlanc, cleared an acre and built a driveway, before construction was stopped due to the lawsuit.

{"text": "The first high spectral resolution X-ray observation of broad-line radio galaxy 3C 390.3 conducted with the High Energy Transmission Grating of the Chandra X-ray Observatory revealed a spectrum of complex emission and absorption features in both the soft X-rays and the Fe K band. Emission and absorption lines in the energy range between 0.7-10 keV associated with ionized Fe L transitions (Fe XVII - XX) were detected, as well as an emission line at the energy of 16.4 keV consistent with Fe Kα. Our best-fit model indicates the presence of three components: a hot emission component likely associated with the hot interstellar medium in the elliptical galaxy (3-4 keV temperature); a warm absorber with log ionization parameter of 5-6 erg s-1 cm, column density of log 8-9 x 10, and outflow velocity of 11-12150 km s-1; and a lowly ionized reflection component likely associated with the optical broad line region or the outer accretion disk.

Descriptive statistics, the Mann-Whitney U-test, and SPSS for Windows were used to analyze a prospectively collected database of operative times and costs from 2008-2011 and compare the SILS and SLS cases on a procedure-matched basis. Analysis of the data suggests that neither consumable costs nor operative time were significantly different between the two groups. Comparisons of operative costs showed cost benefits for SILS appendicectomy, nephrectomy/heminephrectomy, and ovarian cystectomy/oophorectomy compared to SLS (397 vs 467, 942 vs 1127, 394 to 495, respectively). Conversely, a higher cost was observed for the SILS Palomo procedure (734 vs 400). Operative time for SILS appendicectomy, nephrectomy/heminephrectomy, and Palomo was also lower than that of SLS (60 vs 103 minutes, 130 vs 60 mins, 60 vs 80 mins, respectively).

Then, the cell line Hep3B was used to assess the effects of LPS and EGCG at different doses and times. Results found that the highest dose of EGCG (400mM) caused a decrease in SOD levels, increased CAT and GSH levels, and increased TNF-alpha and IL-6 levels. However, doses of 200mM and 100mM of EGCG led to lower levels of inflammation and antioxidant enzyme.

{"text": "We investigate the stability of standing accretion shocks in advection-dominated Schwarzschild black holes by 2D general relativistic hydrodynamic simulations and linear analysis in the equatorial plane. We show that, while the shock is axisymmetrically stable, it becomes unstable to non-axisymmetric perturbations. The simulations match the predictions of linear analysis in terms of the stability, oscillation, and growth-time scales. Comparing different wave-travel times with the growth-time scales of the instability suggests the instability is probably of the Papaloizou-Pringle type, induced by the recurrent passing of acoustic waves. However, the perturbations' wavelengths are too long to precisely determine the reflection point. The non-linear phase of the simulations reveals that quadratic mode couplings come before the eventual non-linear saturation; it also suggests that, apart from random turbulent motions, quasi-periodic oscillations occur over longer time spans. Finally, the results are discussed in regard to possible implications for quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) and the central engine underlying gamma-ray bursts (GRBs).", "label": "gpt3re"}

His defence lawyer read out a report that highlighted that the athlete was not suffering from a mental disorder when he shot Ms. Steenkamp. Oscar denies murder, saying he killed her by mistake out of fear that there was an intruder in the house. The prosecution claims that he deliberately killed her following an argument between the two. Two reports from a psychologist and three psychiatrists were presented in court to evaluate Pistorius' state of mind. Both reports concluded that Pistorius was capable of distinguishing between right and wrong, and did not suffer from Generalised Anxiety Disorder. A further defence witness described Pistorius as anxious and vulnerable, with an \"exaggerated response\" to fear. The second evaluation of Pistorius also stated that he had a history of feeling insecure, and if he did not receive proper clinical care, his condition was likely to get worse and increase the risks of suicide. The court had previously heard that Ms Steenkamp had sent the athlete a message saying: \"I'm scared of you sometimes.\" Final defence witness Wayne Derman said the athlete was an anxious individual with hand tremors and chronic problems with the stumps of his legs, while Pistorius' manager Peet van Zyl said that he had become a \"global icon\" and had a lot of business opportunities since the 2012 London Olympics.

{"text": "The TOR signaling pathway is critical for translating nutritional inputs into the regulation of the protein synthesis machinery, enabling animal growth. We recently discovered Drosophila's ortholog to Bud32 (yeast) / PRPK (human): PRPK (p53-related protein kinase), and found that it is necessary for TOR kinase activity. Bud32/PRPK is an ancient and atypical kinase that has been conserved through evolution from archaea to humans and is essential for the former. It has been conected to the stabilization of p53 in human cell cultures and its absence in yeast induces a slow-growth phenotype. This protein is part of the KEOPS (kinase, putative endopeptidase, and proteins of small size) complex along with KAE1P (ATPase), CGI-121 and PCC1P. This complex has been implicated in telomere maintenance, transcriptional regulation, bud site selection, and chemical modification of tRNAs. Bud32P and KAE1P have been related to N6-threonylcarbamoyladenosine (T6A) synthesis, a specific chemical modification that takes place at the 37th position of tRNAs that pair AU starting codons, which is needed for an accurate translation in the majority of species. Deficiency of this modification leads to mistakes in translation and open reading frame shifts in yeast. The core components of the KEOPS complex are present in Drosophila, yet their physical interaction had not been documented previously. In this review, we examined the findings regarding the role of this complex in different organisms and present newer evidence that gives further insight into PRPK's role in animal growth, showing that depletion of KAE1 or PRPK (optimizing translation in yeast) can trigger the unfolded protein response (UPR) in Drosophila. We propose that the EKC/KEOPS complex could be combining the availability of T6A-modified tRNA with translation rates, which are ultimately reflected in animal growth.", "label": "gpt3re"}
{"text": "The Anti-Trafficking Monitoring Group's report revealed that childcare and specialist health care for victims of trafficking is \"patchy\" and is not routinely provided. Vicky Brotherton, the report's author, noted that having children makes victims even more vulnerable, but this is something the UK is \"unaware of.\" However, Karen Bradley, Home Office minister, mentioned that victims are provided with tailored assistance and the government will soon announce proposals on how to better assist trafficked children. According to the report, around 50% of victims that charities help have children or are pregnant, but there is not a standardized approach to identify and support them. Brotherton added that having children or being pregnant adds \"an extra layer of vulnerability,\" and while there are cases of good practice, these efforts are often hindered by the lack of holistic response.", "label": "gpt3re"}

{"text": "Subsampling and block-based bootstrap methods have been widely used for inference with time series data. These resampling methods are affected by the choice of a bandwidth, such as the subsampling window width and the block size in the block-based bootstrap. The existing first order asymptotic theory does not take into account this effect, so the results of empirical studies may vary depending on the bandwidth parameter. We propose the use of the fixed-@xmath0 approach, as suggested by Kiefer and Vogelsang (2005) in a heteroscedasticity-autocorrelation robust testing context, to account for the bandwidth's influence on inference. Under the fixed-@xmath0 asymptotic framework we derive the asymptotic null distribution of the p-values for subsampling and the moving block bootstrap, and also propose a calibration of the small-@xmath0 based confidence intervals (regions,bands) and tests. We cover both finite dimensional parameters and infinite dimensional parameters, such as the marginal distribution function and the normalized spectral distribution function, making our treatment fairly general. Simulation results indicate that the fixed-@xmath0 approach is better than the traditional small-@xmath0 approach in terms of approximating the finite sample distribution, and that the calibrated confidence sets tend to have smaller coverage errors than the unconstrained ones.

{"text": "This paper, drawing on @xcite, presents an approach to grammar description and processing based on the concept of _cancellation diagrams_, a topic of paramount importance in combinatorial group theory. In this study, the emphasis has been placed on intuitive geometric understanding and the comparison of group-theoretical diagrams to the traditional charts utilized in context-free grammars and type-0 rewriting systems. This paper is organized as follows: in section 1, we explore charts in terms of _cells_, a geometrical analogy to rules; section 2 introduces cancellation diagrams and their practical application; section 3 covers the theoretic material for the concept of _group computation structure_, deriving from the notions of free groups and conjugacy; section 4 elucidates the algebro-geometric aspects of computation by referring to the fundamental theorem of combinatorial group theory @xcite; section 5 looks into the respective concepts of the geometrical and algebraic view at the basis of a simple grammar presented as a group computation structure; section 6 expands the grammar to address non-local constructs, including relative pronouns and quantifiers; and the final section 7 provides notes on the distinctions between normal submonoids and normal subgroups, group computation and rewriting systems, and the usage of group morphisms for examining the computational complexity of parsing and generation.", "label": "gpt3re"}

{"text": "I am not an expert in weapons, but even I can tell the difference between U.S. army rifles during WWI and WWII. In movies, we can see privates armed with the M1 Garand (which was invented in 1932), instead of the accurate 1903 Springfield (also known as the \"Silent Death\") that privates used until WWII. We can tell the difference easily - the M1 can carry and fire around 1.5 times more ammunition than the Springfield and has a three-times higher fire rate. The M1 is semi-automatic, unlike the Springfield which requires reloading after every shot. So, we can see a stark contrast between the two! Moreover, German army uniforms have also been taken from 1940, notably the helmets. German helmets during WWI have a prominent spike on the top, which we do not see on any of the helmets in the movie. After further looking through archives, it makes me question just how truthful this \"True Story\" is.

As a huge horror fan, I believe it is the best of its kind Australia has ever produced, simultaneously being one of the most humorous parody/comedy films to come out in a while. I worry if mainstream audiences might not catch the comedic elements, though - it seemed almost too drawn out in its attempt to insert every cliche the genre has to offer. I can only hope the film was intended to be humorous. Additionally, the gory scenes were amazing - the 'customised' garden shears were so imaginative and they were used to perfection in the violent scenes.

{"text": "We conducted @xmath0 imaging of 12 white dwarf disk candidates from the SDSS DR7 catalog to determine if disks were present. Our findings show that 7 of the white dwarfs have infrared emission; mostly at WISE W1 and W2 bands. Four of these have been identified as being caused by nearby red objects similar to background galaxies or very low mass dwarfs. Additionally, one displays excess emission at @xmath0 which is consistent with an unresolved L0 companion at the correct distance. Although our photometry does not contradict claims that the seven sources originate from disks, the stellar properties differ from known debris disk white dwarfs which casts doubt on this possibility.

This is often called \"indirect effect\" in textbooks but not by the Court itself. In Marleasing SA v La Comercial SA, the Court of Justice ruled that a Spanish Court must interpret its General Civil Code provisions concerning contracts devoid of cause or defrauding creditors, in a way that is consistent with Article 11 of the First Company Law Directive, requiring that incorporations can only be rendered invalid for a specific list of reasons. The Court of Justice made clear that the task of interpretation should not contradict any language used in a national statute. However, fifthly, in cases where a member state has not implemented a Directive, an individual may not be able to take legal action against other parties, but can sue the member state for failure to adhere to the law. This was highlighted during Francovich v Italy, where the Italian government had neglected to set up an insurance fund for employees so that they could claim unpaid wages in the event their employer went bankrupt, as per the requirements of the Insolvency Protection Directive. As a result, Francovich, a former employee of a bankrupt Venetian firm, was allowed to claim 6 million Lira in damages from the Italian government for his loss. The Court of Justice held that when a Directive confers identifiable rights on individuals and there is a direct link between a member state breaching EU law and a claimant's loss, damages must be paid.

Despite the fact that the B- Grade combo of THE TERMINATOR and DIE HARD was not a piece of masterful cinematic art, it's a highly enjoyable action flick that has now attained its place as a cult favourite and inspired two sequels & a spinoff. The plot of Judge and Jury begins with the trial of Joseph Meeker, a murderer that had committed a triple murder during an attempted robbery of a convenience store, leading to his sentencing to death. There's an interesting scene in the lead up to his execution, where he confesses to a priest about his undying love for his partner who had been a victim of the shootout and expresses his desire to take revenge on Michael Silvano, an ex- American football star who spends all his time watching his son practice football and harassing the coaches. However, after his death sentence is carried out, Meeker comes back as a revenant and starts tormenting Silvano as he searches for retribution, taking various guises including an Elvis impersonator, a French chef, a drag queen, a clown and a stand-up comedian. In addition, Meeker has supernatural powers including the ability to avoid death and to carry a shotgun that shoots explosive rounds.Unlike the horror genre, Judge and Jury is a supernatural action movie. Director John Eyres puts the emphasis on exciting fight scenes, but it stands to reason that there's no strong connection between the sequences.

{"text": "The synthesis of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) requires the most energy out of any process in all living cells, with the majority of total transcription activity devoted to rRNA production. Cells may regulate the production of rRNA based on resource availability. This is done primarily through RNA polymerase I, which consists of 14 subunits. Deletions of rpa12, 14, 39, and 49 are all viable. Rpa12 is a tiny protein (13.6 kDa), but is very abundant in cells, with 12,000 molecules present per cell. Its role in other cellular metabolic processes is currently unknown (Kulak et al., 2014 [1]). Rpa12 contains two zinc-binding domains and is necessary for the termination of rRNA synthesis (Mullem et al., 2002 [2]). Deletions of rpa12 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe have a conditional growth defect (Nogi et al., 1993 [3]). In S. pombe, a C-terminal deletion is similar to wild type (Imazawa et al., 2001 [4]). We investigated the physiological role of rpa12 in S. cerevisiae in more detail and deposited the microarray data into Gene Expression Omnibus under GSE68731. The analysis of the microarray data revealed that the expression of major cellular metabolism genes was very high, including amino acid biosynthesis, non-polar lipid biosynthesis, and glucose metabolism genes.

We then simulate the charge transport under voltage bias, employing single-electron tunneling through the junctions between nanoparticles. Examining the regular nanoparticle array as well as topologically inhomogeneous nanonetworks, we explore how they affect the charge transport. We further uncover long-range correlations in the time series of charge fluctuation at individual nanoparticles, as well as the flow along the junctions in the network. These correlations help explain the considerable nonlinearity observed in the simulated and experimentally-measured current-voltage characteristics, as well as the non-Gaussian fluctuations of current found at the electrode.", "label": "gpt3re"}
{"text": "This paper looks at magnetoresistance curves in quasiperiodic magnetic multilayers when considering two different growth directions, [110] and [100]. Ferromagnetic layers of the same type separated by non-magnetic layers with two variable thicknesses as per the Fibonacci sequence were taken into account. Parameters for Fe/Cr multilayers were used to calculate the magnetic energy, which is composed of the Zeeman, cubic anisotropy, bilinear and biquadratic coupling terms. Using the gradient method to determine the lowest energy and its corresponding magnetization, magnetoresistance curves were calculated. It was observed that when biquadratic coupling is greater than bilinear coupling, unusual magnetoresistance traits arise - for the [110] case, different behavior occurs depending on even and odd generations of the Fibonacci sequence and for the [100] case, magnetic field ranges were found to increase magnetoresistance.", "label": "gpt3re"}

Elizabeth Berkly's acting is mediocre compared to what one would usually find on Lifetime. There is no depth or charisma in any of the characters.

The irritating and smarmy lawyer portray a good job of being annoying and laughable at the same time. Furthermore, the police department is a group of insensitive fools, making Barney Fife look competent. I also found it amusing how Josh tried to become a \"victim\".

{"text": "We present the results of numerical adaptive mesh refinement simulations of hydrodynamics and @xmath0 cosmology, focusing on the study of the main properties of massive galaxies ( @xmath1 ) at @xmath2. Structural components such as the one-dimensional density, luminosity, velocity dispersion, and stellar population profiles are carefully evaluated. To better compare to observational data, the method used to estimate velocity dispersion is calibrated influenced by the stellar populations of the simulated galaxies. Having these features in hand, the different properties of massive galaxies in our sample, based on their morphological type, accretion histories, and dynamical properties, are discussed. Our results suggest that galaxy merging history is the main driver in shaping the massive galaxies we observe today. We find that galaxies who have experienced turbulent lives are the most massive, exhibiting the steepest metallicity gradients. In addition, we find that only a small portion (10-50%) of the final stellar mass was formed ex-situ and the majority formed in-situ. Accreted stars are found to be significantly older and less metallic than in-situ stars and usually occupy the most external regions of the galaxies.

{"text": "The organization of interactions within a complex system can be depicted through a network connecting multiple units. This graphical representation is useful in assessing and analyzing the local and global complexity of the underlying systems. The topological structure of the graph can be derived from many sources, such as multiplicative processes and optimization. In networks with cost constraints, like power grids or brain signals, optimization plays an important part in structuration. This paper investigates the topological phase transitions in network designs derived from a Pareto optimization approach, where various simultaneous constraints are taken into account. Three variations of the problem are examined and different phases are associated to various configurations of the connections. The presence and nature of the phase transitions are not only determined by the need of drastic topological modifications but also by the functions needing optimization, elucidating that phase transitions emerge not from the intrinsic properties of a system alone, but from the interaction between the system and its external factors.", "label": "gpt3re"}

She reminded us that these stones are alive, and she shared her own experience of coming here to mourn the loss of her husband for the past 10 years. Through tears, she spoke about the exile and our inability to behold the Temple in its beauty. This moment has been a source of inspiration for me ever since.", "label": "gpt3re"}

{"text": "A 63-year-old man who had been living with esophageal achalasia for more than 20 years now experienced respiratory distress and was admitted to a referral hospital as an emergency three months prior. Upon CT scan, it was shown that his tracheobronchial stenosis was due to advanced esophageal cancer with invasion into the trachea. He received stenting and chemoradiotherapy, but afterwards, an adequately large tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF) developed following 18 Gy irradiation and chemotherapy, leaving him incapable of eating. He was then referred to our hospital, where an esophageal bypass was performed with a gastric conduit; a percutaneous cardiopulmonary support system was set up for anesthesia-related risks of airway obstruction. The use of a small-diameter tracheal tube with the stent allowed for regular respiration during the operation. Anesthesia-related issues were not encountered, and oral intake could be obtained on postoperative Day 9. The patient was discharged on Day 23, being able to take in sustenance orally until the end of his life. Esophageal bypass surgery with general anesthesia can be successful in those with large TEF if the anesthetic management is well-prepared for.", "label": "gpt3re"}

{"text": "Analysis of micrornas in 64 cases of rhabdomyosarcomas (RMS) in children and adolescents revealed distinct expression patterns depending on the presence or absence of pax3/7-foxo1 fusion genes and skeletal muscle features. Integration with parallel gene expression data revealed twelve co-expression networks/modules that correlated with myogenic roles, clinical outcome and fusion status. Reduction of pax3-foxo1 protein demonstrated the regulation of micrornas by the fusion protein, specifically in the case of mir-9-5p. This microrna was found to be connected with poor outcomes and higher levels in metastatic versus non-metastatic disease. Additionally, reduction of mir-9-5p inhibited RMS cell migration. These findings illustrate the regulation of micrornas in a framework of biological and clinical significance in RMS.", "label": "gpt3re"}
{"text": "Since Marx, it has been well understood that the distinguishing factor between societies is the way in which they organize the production, distribution, and utilization of material and symbolic resources. In other words, the mode of production is what defines the material content of the social life of different human collectives (such as nations, peoples, and communities), whereby each of their components evolve in historically specific forms, as well as how various existing modes of production interact within the same society.A mode of production is a configuration of social relations observed in terms of the means of labour, the objects of labour, the labour force, the product of labour, the ownership of each of these components, the mutual relationships of control or dependency, the technical organization of labour processes, how the social product is used, etc. Here, human beings are connected to each other and to nature through material means transformed by social labour.Any productive social activity thus has a natural dimension, and any creative natural activity has a social dimension; that is to say, the social is part of the natural metabolism. The way that humans relate to nature is thus part of the characteristics of a particular mode of production. The transformation of nature, be it in a hut, a field, a dam, or a tool, is necessary for the existence of life on this planet. In the case of any pre-capitalist modes of production, human activity has greatly modified the natural environment—from the terraces of the Andes to the ridges of the Amazon. However, what separates these transformations of nature from those done by capitalism is that non-capitalist societies rely on the regenerative capacity of the altered environment and foster its continuation in order to provide for the use values of future generations. This organic and living perception of nature that these societies previously manifested has been undermined by modern capitalist modes of production.", "label": "gpt3re"}

{"text": "Smart electricity meters with cellular radio interface have added additional load on wireless cellular networks. Meters are currently designed for low-duty billing and occasional system checks, creating low-rate sporadic traffic. However, as the number of distributed energy resources increases, household power will become more variable and difficult to predict by distribution systems operators (DSO). It is expected that more wide area measurement system (WAMS) devices with phasor measurement unit (PMU)-like capabilities will be added to the distribution grid to monitor low-voltage quality and provide the desired information for grid control. From a communication standpoint, the changes in traffic will be drastic, with higher data volumes and rates. This paper studies the current smart electricity meter traffic and adds the potential, enhanced meter traffic with PMU-like capabilities. Our research demonstrates how GSM/GPRS and LTE cellular systems respond to the current and next generation smart meter traffic. It shows how PMU data will place extra strain on the wireless systems. Solutions to upgrade cellular standards so that they can manage upcoming smart meter traffic are identified in light of the findings.", "label": "gpt3re"}

Group A consisted of experienced surgeons who had performed over 500 times of CM nail, while Group B consisted of non-experienced surgeons who had carried out less than 50 times of CM nail. Clinical and radiologic outcomes, complications, and the need for reoperation between the two groups were compared. The results showed that mean operation time and transfusion volume were significantly longer and larger in Group B (p<0.05). There was no statistical difference in the radiologic outcomes between both groups, including adequacy of reduction, tip-apex distance, and numbers of incidences placed in the Cleveland zones 5, 6, and 8. The rate of complication and reoperation had the same results as radiologic outcomes. Ultimately, there was no significant difference in the complications from CM nail for femoral intertrochanteric fractures between experienced and non-experienced surgeons.

In Scotland, they are able to create prescriptions of regular drugs other than controlled drugs for Scottish registered patients, when the patient is unable to speak to their medical provider, such as when they are out of town. In the US, the Doctor of Pharmacy (Pharm. D.) degree has become a necessity for practice and some pharmacists have one or two years' more residency or fellowship learning after graduation.

{"text": "The Court of Justice held in R (Daily Mail and General Trust plc) v HM Treasury that Member States could restrict the relocation of companies' seats of business without infringing TFEU article 49. This allowed for the UK to prevent the Daily Mail newspaper's parent company from avoiding tax bills by shifting residence to the Netherlands. In contrast, in Centros Ltd v Erhversus-og Selkabssyrelsen the Court of Justice found that a UK limited company operating in Denmark could not be forced to adhere to Denmark's regulations concerning minimum capital requirements. Since the UK only required £1 of capital to start a company and Denmark required 200,000 Danish krone (~€27 000), this law was found to be an infringement of Centros Ltd's freedom of establishment, as alternative less restrictive measures could have been taken. This is comparable to the US situation, which takes advantage of low standards of accountability and corporate taxes. Additionally, in Überseering BV v Nordic Construction GmbH, the Court of Justice stipulated that a German court could not deny a Dutch building company the right to enforce a contract in Germany simply based on the fact that it was not incorporated in Germany. The Court of Justice then clarified its position in Cartesio Oktató és Szolgáltató bt, expressing that corporations created by law are subjected to the rules of formation of the state in which they are incorporated.

The Northern Ireland Commonwealth Games Council still intends to confirm its commitment to the Games, but the Department of Economy declared last week that it was unable to allocate funding for it as it is not deemed ‘value for money’. Ulster Unionist MLA Alan Chambers has expressed embarrassment and Green Party leader Steven Agnew has said that the party's inability to provide a stable government has had a large impact. Alliance MLA Chris Lyttle has said that the business case delay has left the NI Commonwealth Games Council in limbo and urged Northern Ireland take this opportunity and showcase their world-class capabilities.

{"text": "This study was conducted to evaluate the incidence of cranial nerve (VI,VII,VIII) palsy and its clinical course following microvascular decompression (MVD) for hemifacial spasm (HFS). Of the 1354 patients who underwent MVD for HFS between 1998 and 2009, 100 (7.4%) experienced delayed facial palsy (DFP). One patient developed delayed isolated VIth nerve palsy and one had delayed hearing loss. DFP occurred on average 11 days postoperatively, with complete recovery occurring for 92% of the patients within 64 days. The delayed sixth nerve palsy and hearing loss did not improve. These findings suggest that delayed cranial nerve (VI,VII,VIII) palsies after uncomplicated MVD for HFS may occur, and that DFP is a potential complication of MVD; however, delayed sixth nerve palsy and hearing loss are rare complications. Therefore, these conditions should be considered during follow up for MVD.", "label": "gpt3re"}

Featuring the sleeker and futuristic art style from The New Batman Adventures and minor use of CGI, the animation was quite nicely done and similar to Return of the Joker's artwork. The soundtrack was also decent and had some hints of nostalgia from the original animated Batman theme.

{"text": "We studied the continuum and emission-line properties of 224 Broad Absorption Line Quasars (BALQSOs) selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Early Data Release (EDR), which contains 3814 bona fide quasars. We found that Low-Ionization BALQSOs (LoBALs) are significantly more reddened than normal quasars, consistent with previous research. High-Ionization BALQSOs (HiBALs) are also more reddened than average non-BALQSOs. Assuming an SMC-like dust reddening at the quasar redshift, the reddening for HiBALs is @xmath1 and LoBALs is @xmath2 (compared to the average of the entire quasar sample). We discovered differences in the emission-line properties between the average HiBAL, LoBAL, and non-BALQSO. These dissimilarities, in conjunction with differences in the absorption line troughs, could be related to intrinsic quasar characteristics like the gradient of the intrinsic (unreddened) continuum; more extreme absorption features correlate with bluer intrinsic continuums. Despite the differences between BALQSO sub-types and non-BALQSOs, BALQSOs appear to be pulled from the same parent population as non-BALQSOs when both are chosen via their UV/optical properties. We found that the total fraction of traditionally defined BALQSOs, after correcting for color-dependent selection biases resulting from the different SEDs of BALQSOs and non-BALQSOs, is @xmath3%, and is not significantly affected by redshift for @xmath4. After a rough completeness adjustment for the effects of dust extinction, we estimate that around one in every six quasars is a BALQSO. ", "label": "gpt3re"}

{"text": "The Bering Strait separates Russia from North America and lies above the Bering Land Bridge (BLB), which is also known as Beringia (sometimes misspelled Beringea). The land mass is believed to have once included the Seward Peninsula, as well as existing land areas of northeast Siberia and western Alaska. As a waterway, it connects the Pacific Ocean to the Arctic Ocean, and eventually to the Atlantic Ocean. It is believed that the environment of the BLB during the Pleistocene was primarily a herbaceous tundra or steppe-tundra. However, recent pollen studies show that during the Last Glacial Maximum (from around 30,000 to 18,000 calendar years ago), the land mass was a mosaic of diverse but cold habitats. The Bering Land Bridge is only above sea level when the sea level drops about 50 meters (~164 feet) below its present position. It has been determined that it was exposed during Oxygen Isotope Stage 3 (60,000 to 25,000 years ago). It is generally believed that the land bridge was the primary entryway for the original settlers of America. One theory proposed, the Beringian Standstill Hypothesis, or Beringian Incubation Model (BIM), suggests that the migrants lived in the BLB for several millennia before entering North America.

{"text": "The objective of this literature review was to assess the efficacy of ketamine in the treatment of suicidal ideation. To that end, a PubMed and Cochrane database search was conducted, covering the period up to January 2015, to explore relevant clinical trials, case reports and associated literature related to the pharmacological effects of ketamine. A total of nine papers (six studies and three case reports) met the criteria for evaluation of suicidal ideation after receiving a subanesthetic dose of ketamine. Although none of these examined the effect on suicide attempts or death by suicide, all studies showed a quick and clinically significant reduction in suicidal ideation within a similar range to that previously observed regarding ketamine as a treatment of depression proofing resistant to treatment. In total, 137 patients exhibiting suicidal ideation have been reported in the literature to have been treated with ketamine. Doses ranged from 0.5 mg/kg syringed intravenously over 40 minutes, to 0.2 mg/kg syringed intravenously (one study), or in liquid suspension (one study). Initial significant results were noted after 40 minutes, while the longest efficacy was seen up to 10 days post-infusion. In conclusion, evidence suggests that ketamine has rapid efficacy in reducing not only depressive symptoms, but also suicidal ideation, with minor short-term side effects. Further studies are necessary to further analyze its mechanism of action, long-term outcomes, long-term benefits and abuse, so that it can be used as a prototype for further development of a rapid acting anti-suicidal medication with the most favorable risk/benefit ratio, and a practical route of administration.", "label": "gpt3re"}

{"text": "The Democratic National Committee's rule-making body on Saturday voted down an amendment brought forward by Bernie Sanders delegates to abolish the system of superdelegates, which allows 15 percent of all delegates to cast an unconstrained vote for the presidential nominee of their choice. In place of this, they approved a compromise measure, binding some superdelegates to the outcome of the state primaries.The amendment, which failed to pass by a vote of 108 to 58, posed a conflict between party leaders and the insurgent Sanders supporters, many of whom maintained that eliminating superdelegates would increase democracy by ensuring all presidential delegates are elected by popular vote. Those who opposed it argued that the system of superdelegates allowed for a variety of voices and that any changes to the system should require careful deliberation. A Unity Commission proposal, with language created by the Sanders and Clinton camps, passed the committee with a vote of 158 to 6. Its purpose is to assemble shortly after the general election in order to make adjustments to the party's nomination process. Under these terms, members of Congress, governors, and distinguished party leaders will remain unpledged and permitted to follow the nominee of their choice, while the remaining unpledged delegates must abide by the results of their state primaries.", "label": "gpt3re"}

While most of these radio jets are quite short and faint, with only a few exceptions such as 3C 273 and M 87, which facilitate detailed examined spectroscopic and morphological studies, these jets can be surprisingly prominent in X-rays. With about 30 jets detected in the @xmath1keV energy range, the nature of this emission is still being questioned. Both optical and X-ray jet observations pose serious issues for traditional radiation models for the discussed objects. Studies of M 87 suggest the potential of generating large photon fluxes at the high energies by its extended jet and here in this paper, we summarise data regarding multi-wavelength emission of the large-scale jets. Additionally, we highlight modifications of the traditional jet radiation models, such as relativistic bulk velocities, jet radial stratification and particle energization along the jet, that potentially could explain some of the puzzeling observations. We also comment on @xmath0-ray emission of the mentioned objects.", "label": "gpt3re"}

In dentistry, Co-Cr alloys are generally employed for the fabrication of metal frameworks for removable partial dentures and have recently been used for metallic substructures in porcelain-fused-to-metal restorations and implant frameworks. The increasing global demand for Co-Cr alloys for dental applications is mainly due to their low cost and satisfactory physical and mechanical properties. Additionally, amongst base-metal alloys, Co-Cr alloys are gaining preference, as opposed to nickel-chromium (Ni-Cr) alloys, due to the increasing worry about the potential toxicity of Ni-containing alloys when exposed to the oral cavity.

Sixty-five patients (mean age 43.8 years) with the condition underwent standard laparoscopic pyeloplasty by transperitoneal approaches, with majority (57 patients) presenting with flank pain and the remainder detected incidentally. Mean stricture length was 1.06 cm and grade 3/4 and 4/4 hydronephrosis was detected in 36 and 14 patients, respectively, with an obstructive pattern present on the renal scan in 53 patients (81.5%). Results of the study showed that 57 patients were treated with dismembered Anderson-Hynes pyeloplasty and 8 patients with Fenger pyeloplasty. During the operation, crossing vessels were found in 27 patients (41.5%), with a mean operating time of 159.42 minutes. No open conversions were seen, although there were two postoperative cases of colon and spleen injuries. Mean starting time of postoperative ambulation and diet was 1.54 and 1.86 days, respectively, with mean hospital stay of 8.09 days and mean follow-up period of 36.5 months. Follow-up intravenous pyelography and renal scan showed improvement in 59 patients (90.8%), with the overall success rate being 87.7%. The comparative analysis between the success and failure groups indicated drained amount to be the only factor related to failure (554.41 ml vs. 947.70 ml, p=0.024). In conclusion, the long-term follow-up results support laparoscopic pyeloplasty as a standard treatment for ureteropelvic junction obstruction, with drained amount as a risk factor for failure of the operation.", "label": "gpt3re"}

{"text": "South Asia meteorology officials admit they have been slow to consider the role of fresh waters in their weather forecasting models. This is particularly cause for concern, as monsoons provide 70% of the rainfall in India and neighbouring countries between June and September. Extreme weather events, including longer dry periods and heavier rainfall within short spaces of time during monsoon season, have been on the rise due to climate change. Scientists with the Ocean Mixing and Monsoon project have found a sharp division between river and seawater and researchers believe that the interaction between freshwater and the monsoon could be a missing piece of the puzzle. Shamshuddin Ahmed, the Deputy Director General of Bangladesh's Meteorology Department, said that his department only looked at wind speed, direction and water vapour in the atmosphere for monsoon prediction models and that no serious research had been done to account for freshwater. Mohammed Hanif, of Pakistan's Meteorology Department, also said that freshwater was not on their radar for sea surface temperature predictions. A team of international scientists are currently researching the issue, with the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology agreeing that their models need to be updated to consider the interaction between fresh waters and the monsoon. However, sharing data between countries on water resources has been a contentious issue for years.Meteorology officials in South Asia have been urged to consider the importance of less saline water in their weather forecasting models. As monsoons account for 70% of the region's rainfall between June and September, climate change has caused longer dry periods and heavier rainfall within a short space of time during monsoon season in recent years. A team of international researchers are currently investigating if the interaction between freshwater and the monsoon could be responsible. For the most part, South Asian countries are not accounting for freshwater in their models and are only looking at wind speed, direction and water vapour in the atmosphere to predict monsoon rains. Finding out year-to-year variability of freshwater inputs into the ocean is seen as a priority as it could be the missing piece of the puzzle, but this data is hard to acquire due to the tension between India and its neighbours about sharing such information. Thus, countries in the region need to come to a mutual understanding if they truly want to keep tabs on fresewater's influence on the area's monsoons.", "label": "gpt3re"}

He then encounters a communication device where Harlan Doyle leads him through islands, shipwrecks, jungles, installations and volcanoes, attempting to save Valerie Constantine, while also fending off mutated super soldiers and genetically modified animals.The Movie, in comparison, is almost unrecognisable: The first third of the movie consists of irrelevant back story; Jack essentially just walks onto the beach, kills some hired goons and gets away; there is no \"\"communicator\"\" with Doyle; the altered troopers look like pale beings in T-shirts; and there are no mutated monkeys springing out of the shrubs.

{"text": "We present a method for taking into account correlations in the impact parameter space description of multiple (semi-)hard partonic collisions in high-energy hadron-hadron scattering. To do so, we employ the factorization theorem for inclusive dijet production with a lower transverse momentum cutoff and then fix the widths of the transverse distributions of hard partons through two-gluon form factor parameterizations. This then allows us to calculate the hard contribution to the total inelastic profile function, accounting for correlation corrections which are larger than those found in the typically used eikonal approach. By examining the rate of double collisions measured at the Tevatron, we estimate the magnitude of double correlation corrections. We conclude that such corrections are required in order to agree with expectations of the total inelastic proton-proton cross section at LHC energies, when the typical values for the lower transverse momentum cutoff are used for the inclusive hard dijet cross section calculation.", "label": "gpt3re"}

The first time the level was raised to \"critical\" was on August 10th, 2006, when it was determined that a plot to blow up planes from Britain to America was in effect, around nine days after the threat scale was made public. The second time this level was reached was on June 30th, 2007, when there was a car attack on Glasgow Airport, which had a single fatality amongst the perpetrators. In each situation, the level was kept at \"critical\" for a maximum of four days. Prior to being raised to \"critical\" on May 23rd, 2017, the threat level was a \"severe\" rating for 998 days.

{"text": "In order to gain confidence in gyrokinetic simulations and improve their predictive capabilities, we require gyrokinetic validation studies. In our experiment, we use the GENE code to simulate an ASDEX Upgrade discharge and compare various fluctuating quantities with experimental measurements. The approach we take is to first carry out linear simulations in order to determine the turbulence regime. We then adjust the logarithmic ion temperature gradient within the expected error bar range to get the heat fluxes in the nonlinear simulations to match the experimental fluxes. After that, we analyze the dependence between various quantities and the ion temperature gradient in detail. We find that density and temperature fluctuations can be greatly affected by small changes to this parameter, making comparisons with experiments highly sensitive to uncertainties in the experimental profiles. However, we observe that cross-phases are more robust, making them better observables for comparisions between gyrokinetic simulations and experimental measurements.", "label": "gpt3re"}

Results demonstrated that K/CC had the highest BFS significantly, followed by K/LV, whilst those of K/CZR, K/EM, and K/VT were not significantly different from each other, but were significantly lower than the others. The Weibull distribution also reported consistent trends with the BFS results.

A diagnostic laparoscopy was the initial procedure conducted, which revealed the appendix in the hernia sac. Laparoscopic appendectomy was then carried out before open exploration of the groin. This successful procedure allowed us to diagnose and treat the hernia with an appendectomy without the need for a groin incision. This suggests that laparoscopy can be an effective tool in diagnosing and managing such hernias.", "label": "gpt3re"}

Their body fluids normally have the same concentration as seawater. When transitioning to less dense brackish water, the ciliary rosettes within the body cavity cause the mesoglea to have more bulk, which in turn reduces its density and prevents the organism from sinking. On the other hand, when the ctenophore moves from brackish to normal seawater, the ciliary rosettes pump water out of the mesoglea in order to increase the organism's density and ultimately reduce its volume.", "label": "gpt3re"}

Results showed that there was a linear relationship between UV-dose up to 1,000 mJ cm2 and vitamin D2 content. Repeated UV-B exposure resulted in an increased vitamin D2 content of 33 g/100 g1 while growth was unaffected. Post-harvest exposure to supplementary UV-B resulted in a higher vitamin D2 content of 32 g/100 g1 compared to 24 g/100 g1 obtained from exposure during the growth phase. Wild and cultivated mushrooms with and without exposure to sunlight had vitamin D2 content in the range of 0.21-0.5 g/100 g1.

To make our method suitable for gauging, casting it in a gauge-invariant form is crucial. We performed numerous tests which confirmed its agreement with Statistical Mechanics principles. With this method, we estimate paraconductivity of a superconducting wire and obtain the Aslamazov-Larkin result in a limiting situation. Our method is numerically stable, with a nonlinear term that is easily included.

Materials and Methods: 171 suspected metastatic lesions were sampled with a 22-23 g needle and fixed and stained smears were prepared. For cases in which the primary site was not evident, comprehensive physical examination and radiological investigations were used to search for the primary source. Histopathological examination was performed in 16 cases with inconclusive cytology impressions. Observations: 155 cases (90.6%) were diagnosed through fine needle aspiration biopsy and 16 cases (9.4%) were determined by histology. The greatest number of cases occurred in the fifth (47.4%), sixth (44.4%), and seventh (6.4%) decades of life. Lymph nodes were the most frequent site of metastasis for 115 cases (67.3%), primarily in the cervical region. The oropharynx, including the oral cavity and pharyngolarynx, was the most frequently identified primary site with 55 cases (32.2%).Conclusion: Accurately determining the primary site in tandem with related pathology and clinical data is essential for the successful evaluation of metastatic cases.

As the signs of twist and writhe tended to agree with each other in most cases of the \"writhed\" type (12 of 13), they proposed a magnetic model wherein the emerging flux regions in an @xmath0 AR are not separate entities but come together to form a single structure beneath the solar surface. It was also observed that almost all \"writhed\"-type ARs have downward-knotted structures in the middle of the magnetic flux tube, which is suggested to be the essential property of @xmath0 ARs. A correlation between flare activity and umbral area of @xmath0 ARs was established, with a possible scaling law existing between the flare index and the maximum umbral area.", "label": "gpt3re"}
{"text": "The current study aimed to assess the impact of Melissa officinalis capsules on premenstrual syndrome (PMS) symptoms in high school girls. To assess its effectiveness, a double-blind randomized, placebo-controlled trial was conducted on 100 participants from 2013 to 2014. The intervention group (n=50) were administered 1200 mg of M. officinalis essence daily from the first to the last day of their menstrual cycle for three consecutive cycles, while the placebo group (n=50) received a placebo. The premenstrual symptom screening tool was used to measure the intensity of PMS symptoms in the two groups prior to the start of the intervention, and every month for three consecutive months following the intervention. Paired t-tests and repeated measures analysis of variance were used to analyse the data. The results of this study revealed a statistically significant decrease (p<0.001) in PMS symptoms. Specifically, the mean score of PMS intensity in the intervention group was 42.56 +/- 15.73 prior to the start of the intervention, which changed to 32.72 +/- 13.24, 30.02 +/- 12.08 and 13.90 +/-10.22 at the three consecutive months after the intervention, respectively (p=0.001). Thus, this study concluded that M. officinalis capsules can be an effective form of treatment for PMS symptoms. However, further research is required to determine its efficacy.", "label": "gpt3re"}

{"text": "I was so impressed after reading this novel once again after many years. When I think back to the numerous TV adaptations, I remember Darcy as the snobbish and dismissive character that belittles almost everyone he meets. However, now I realise how much more complex, and interesting, the plot is than what I knew. Most people are familiar with the typical Romeo and Juliet plot of initial hostility towards each other changing into love. However, as Austen reveals, it is more of a one-sided situation with Elizabeth feeling animosity towards Darcy following one night. Even though they are put in many situations where they are in the same house and she is able to observe his behaviour, she is solely conscious of his arrogant nature, unaware of his admiration and fascination for her, expressed through his facial expressions and mannerisms. This could be because Elizabeth’s own pride has been hurt by Darcy and does not even consider the possibility of her social inferiority being the barrier for them. Austen’s writing style, giving the reader insight into the characters’ thoughts and feelings, has us understand what they will have to let go of in order to attain happiness. In Darcy’s case, it is his rigid class consciousness and refusal to see Elizabeth as a match for him in spite of his admiration for her. On the other hand, we realise Elizabeth’s blinkered attitude in adhering to social strata and deny that Darcy may desire her company.", "label": "gpt3re"}

This method of selection has caused an increase in novel traits and other curiosities, which may not be sustainable in a natural environment but are popular in a commercial setting. While cat-breeders may have financial motivations, many also seek to optimize certain aspects of existing breeds, such as coat quality in Persians, expanding color range, eliminating hereditary illness and perfecting body type. However, in attempting to do this, genetic disasters may occur, which cause physical mutations that could have previously only been avoided. Roger Tabor's book, \"The Rise of The Cat\" (1991) further explains that these mutations for the sake of difference have led to potential harm for the cat. Therefore, selective breeding can lead to cats with better temperaments, making them more suitable for keeping as pets or animals on farms.", "label": "gpt3re"}

{"text": "It has been proven that phonons (collective atomic vibrations in solids) are more efficient at transferring heat than photons. This explains why conduction (mediated by phonons) is the dominant method of heat transport in nonmetals compared to radiation (mediated by photons). Yet, due to their inability to traverse a vacuum gap, it was believed that two bodies separated by a gap could not exchange heat through phonons. A recent study @xcite proposed a mechanism in which phonons could carry out heat transfer across a vacuum gap. This is achieved through van der waals interaction between two bodies with a gap that is smaller than the wavelength of light. Heat transfer methods like these are important for heating and cooling of nanostructures; such as flying heads in magnetic storage disks. The research was later extended to study phonon transmission between two bodies constructed of different materials and separated by a vacuum gap; concluding results included the calculation of heat transfer magnitudes between materials commonly used in microelectromechanical industries and that of conduction heat transfer through air for small gaps.", "label": "gpt3re"}

{"text": "Molecular dynamics simulations of solutions of flexible polyelectrolyte chains at nonzero concentrations, with explicit counterions and unscreened Coulombic interactions, were conducted at a constant temperature. Counterion condensation, as measured by the self-diffusion coefficient of the counterions, is observed to increase with polymer concentration; however, contrary to Manning theory, the renormalized charge fraction on the chains decreases with increased Bjerrum length without any sign of saturation. A scaling analysis of the radius of gyration found that the chains were extended at low concentrations and small Bjerrum lengths, while at sufficiently large Bjerrum lengths, the chains shrank to create compact structures with exponents that were lower than those of a Gaussian chain, indicating the presence of attractive intrachain interactions. A detailed examination of the radial distribution function of the center-of-mass of the polyelectrolyte chains demonstrated that effective interchain attractive interactions also exist in solutions of flexible polyelectrolytes, similar to those found for rodlike polyelectrolytes. Our findings indicate that the wide maximum seen in scattering experiments is a consequence of clustering of chains.", "label": "gpt3re"}

Human antibodies to both parasites can be found with ELISA kits designed to detect them in human serum, so the quids were rehydrated and tested. All tests yielded negative results and the lack of prior literature makes it uncertain as to if the tests used were incorrect or the people of CMC simply didn't have the parasites.

For the first time, we conduct cosmological simulations with a detailed chemical network that incorporates both primordial species and carbon, oxygen, silicon, and silicon-1 in order to study the formative stages of carbon-enhanced, metal-poor stars. A background UV flux can delay the collapse from 2 to 3 and cool the gas to the CMB temperature given a metallicity of Z/Zsol = 10^-5. This could likely lead to the creation of lower mass stars. Generally, it appears that metals have a much greater influence on the collapse than radiation, demonstrating similar thermal structures in spite of the differing intensities of radiation. However, the radiative backgrounds cannot delay the collapse when Z/Zsol = 10^-6 or if the abundance of carbon is similar to that of SMSS J031300.36-670839.3.", "label": "gpt3re"}

Jacoby's performance as Hamlet and Patrick Stewart's as Claudius make the duration worthwhile. The clarity and sequence of \"\"Hamlet\"\" when seen in its entirety is invigorating. Every adaptation of \"\"Hamlet\"\" has re-arranged the structure; Olivier concentrated on the protagonist's indecision and Gibson on his emotions. With the help of the entire Shakespearian script, Jacoby amalgamates all the of Hamlet's aspects together.Behind Hamlet's deferral to kill Claudius immediately is the reason that he wants to claim the throne as his own. He is bitter at his mother's remarriage,his father's death and Claudius' crime of confiscating the throne from him. Even after he hears his father's ghost imploring him for retribution, Hamlet refrains from murdering his uncle since this would lead to him being denied the throne. His yearning for revenge, the throne, and the damnation Claudius in hell- all this reigns his ambition down and ultimately proves to be the source of his destruction. He commits the blunder of killing Polonius mistakenly, leading to an aftermath with the tragic ends of Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, Ophelia, Laertes, Gertrude, Claudius and Hamlet himself.", "label": "gpt3re"}

{"text": "Data from physical contacts and face-to-face communications suggest that temporal networks are a significant platform for the transmission of illnesses among humans and animals. The difficulty of studying epidemic processes on temporal networks is a result of the complexity of both its structure and temporal dimensions. There is a need for theoretical approaches that identify key factors that affect the dynamics of epidemics, such as what makes some temporal networks more susceptible to spreading infections than others. We develop a theory to understand the Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) model on arbitrary temporal networks, with each contact lasting for a finite duration. Our findings indicate that temporality of networks reduces the epidemic threshold, allowing infections to persist more easily in temporal networks than in their static counterparts. Additionally, we conclude that the Lie commutator bracket of the adjacency matrices at different times is a crucial determinant of the epidemic threshold. The effect of temporality on the epidemic threshold, which depends on the dataset, is approximately predicted by the magnitude of commutator norm.

{"text": "Identifying the processes that control the strength, longevity, and fluctuation of protostellar mass gain is essential to any star formation theory. In this paper, I discuss protostellar mass accretion rates (𝑥𝑚𝑎𝑡ℎ0) from numerical models that trace the transformation of a turbulent molecular cloud into a stellar cluster. In crowded cluster environments, 𝑥𝑚𝑎𝑡ℎ0 is highly variable and affected by the interconnectedness of protostellar cores and their competition for the same cluster gas store. Despite having the same eventual mass, each protostar's accretion histories can be drastically different. High mass stars start to form in the early stages of cluster formation and continue to develop at a rapid pace until the available gas is consumed or forced out by feedback. Lower mass stars, however, typically appear in later stages and 𝑥𝑚𝑎𝑡ℎ0 decrease sharply after a brief period of rapid increase.

{"text": "We present a mechanism that can explain the properties of the Fe K line, specifically why its centroid line energy is below 6.7 keV and why it appears to be broad. Drawing from recent evidence of nonthermal components of the Galactic X-ray background, we offer a model that is a combination of thermal plasma components (potentially from supernovae) and nonthermal emission from the interaction of low-energy cosmic ray electrons (LECRE) with the interstellar medium. Atomic collisions of LECRE are responsible for narrow X-ray emission lines that describe Galactic background data. Our analysis, using ASCA GIS archival data from the Scutum Arm region, successfully models two thermal plasma components at temperatures of 1 and 2 keV, as well as a LECRE component. Our conclusion rules out nonthermal-only origins for the emission and significant contributions from low-energy cosmic ray ions - due to excessive Galaxy-wide BE production rate and nuclear X-ray line diffuse emission exceeding upper limits obtained from OSSE. The proposed model provides a natural explanation for observed complex line features and does away with the need for a very hot thermal component (3 keV).

That being said, the best music video to ever be created has to be Michael Jackson's Thriller. It was like a movie, with amazing acting, dancing, and singing. The story details a young woman dating a man, but is the man really a man or something more sinister? Vincent Price's contributions to the video only made it better. Michael Jackson was perfection, showcasing the classic MJ without the multiple facelifts - though there was plenty of makeup and costumes used. For anyone who hasn't seen this fourteen minute masterpiece, I highly recommend taking the time to check it out on YouTube.", "label": "gpt3re"}

{"text": "In this discussion, we examine the impact of electrical effects on spin transport, centering on the propagation and waning of spin-polarized electrons while taking inhomogeneous electric fields into consideration. We conclude that electric field gradients have a major influence on spin relaxation lengths, and can cause a significant decrease in electron spin polarization. Utilizing a drift-diffusion picture, as well as self-consistent numerical computations based on a Boltzmann-Poisson approach, we discover that spin relaxation lengths can actually reach the proportions of charge screening lengths.", "label": "gpt3re"}

The win marked the Redbirds' first against a Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) team since Sept. 14, 1991, against Akron and their fifth straight victory over Eastern Michigan, who went scoreless in the second half.Led by two second-half touchdown runs from Darrelynn Dunn and a 22-yard touchdown pass from Matt Brown to Donovan Harden, Dunn amassed his second consecutive 100-plus yard performance, rushing 32 times and finishing with 130 yards, while Brown finished with 14 completions for 155 yards, one touchdown and one interception. Tyrone Walker and Lechein Neblett each had four receptions, Ben Ericksen intercepted two passes while Shelby Harris had eight tackles and Nate Palmer recorded 1.5 sacks.The Redbirds opened the game with a Jonathon Miller 58-yard touchdown run and held a 10-0 lead after a Nick Aussieker 26-yard field goal, but the Eagles answered with a 6-play, 84-yard touchdown drive, capped off by a 32-yard pass from Alex Gillett to Garrett Hoskins, making the score 10-7.

{"text": "For nearly two decades, researchers have studied the molecular mechanisms and signalling pathways that trigger Group I Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor (Gi-mGluR)-dependent Long Term Depression (LTD). The use of genetically modified animals has been essential in elucidating the involvement of key molecules in the induction and maintenance of mGluR-LTD. In this review, we will discuss the role of the recently discovered MAPKAPK-2 (MK2) and MAPKAPK-3 (MK3) signalling cascade in regulating Gi-mGluR-LTD. Studies have established that the absence of MK2 impairs the induction of Gi-mGluR-dependent LTD, an effect caused by decreased internalization of AMPA receptors (AMPAR). As the MK2 cascade directly regulates tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF) production, this review will analyze evidence that the release of TNF regulates glutamate receptor expression and potentially causes the impairment of Gi-mGluR-dependent LTD and the cognitive deficits found in MK2/3 double knockout animals. These strong connections between increased TNF production and aging as well as neurodegenerative diseases could implicate MK2's action in these processes.", "label": "gpt3re"}
{"text": "The data of 89 players suggests that there is quite a bit of randomness involved in interceptions and defended passes from one year to the next. Therefore, last year's interception/defended pass percentage has little effect on the next year's percentage. To illustrate this point, for the top 9 players, their second-year interception percentage was 52.2%, significantly higher than their first year of 40.4%. Meanwhile, the 10th to 19th players had a second year interception percentage of 41.3%, which was significantly higher than the 25.3% from the first year. The numbers decreased as the group progressed until finally, the last group had a second year interception percentage of 4.7%, which was slightly lower than the 23.7% from the first year. These numbers demonstrate that beyond the top names, it is difficult to deduce individual successes in interceptions or defended passes. Therefore, this is good news for Merrill Noel of Wake Forest who only had 8% of his passes defended in 2008, but picked off 64% in 2009.", "label": "gpt3re"}

Additionally, we will analyze the area and Hamiltonian operators and explore how they correlate to the topology.

{"text": "This study sought to investigate the source of the inconsistencies found in literature regarding the occurrence of euphoria in a subgroup of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. The authors compared the results obtained through the use of the classical interview of Cottrell and Wilson and the contemporary Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) in a population of 100 MS patients and 100 matched controls during a one-off interview. The researchers found a high incidence of euphoria using the classical measure in the MS group in comparison to the control group, but significantly lower rates using the contemporary definition and measure. These findings suggest that the contradictions found in literature regarding this symptom stem from the varying definitions and measurement instruments rather than from a shift in the occurrence of euphoria in MS patients. This study further highlights the importance of specifying what defines pathological euphoria and of developing better definitions and measurements for it.", "label": "gpt3re"}
{"text": "The British film 'Separate Lies' is a truly remarkable piece of work. Emily Watson and Tom Wilkinson make a great team, with Rupert Everett and Linda Bassett rounding out the stellar supporting cast. Each character is complex, with moral contradictions that leave us intrigued as to how each of them will tackle the issue of truth and lies; yet, at their core, there is a streak of decency that binds them together. Watson's Anne Manning is particularly compelling, as she serves as the moral conscience for the other characters. There are no obvious action sequences or dramatic scenes, yet the intense emotion and raw human experience draw the audience in. Tony Pierce-Roberts' cinematography, Stanislas Syrewicz's music, and Zbignew Priesner's score add to the atmosphere of the film in compelling ways. The performances by Watson, Wilkinson, Everett, and Bassett are all fantastic, particularly Watson's in her debut Breaking the Waves 1996.

{"text": "The measurements of the Intergalactic Medium temperature provide a useful way to assess the reionisation history, due to the thermal effect caused by the ionisation of neutral hydrogen. However, until recent times, temperature measurements were only available at redshift 0, limiting its usefulness in examining the reionisation history at higher redshifts. In this research project, new measurements of the IGM temperature around seven quasars at high redshifts were observed and compared to a semi-numerical model of inhomogeneous reionisation. This model was calibrated to agree with observations of electron scattering optical depth and photo-ionisation rate, and used to calculate the temperature distribution at redshift 3 under various reionisation scenarios. With our standard assumptions on the ionising spectrum of Population II sources, the near-zone temperature measurements suggest that reionisation was complete at a redshift of @xmath4 @xmath5 with 68 (95) per cent confidence. This study demonstrates that further measurements of temperatures around other high redshift quasars could help to increase the accuracy and applicability of this technique.

Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with heterogenous pathological and clinical symptoms, and its cognitive dysfunction is a risk factor for poor prognosis and shows inter-individual variation in its progression. This review evaluates the diagnostic utility of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, including alpha-synuclein (-syn), total tau, phosphorylated tau at Thr181, and amyloid-1-42, in predicting future cognitive decline in PD patients. It is hypothesized that the interaction between Alzheimer's pathology and -syn pathology is vital to the progression of cognitive dysfunction in PD, and longitudinal studies must be conducted to prove this.

{"text": "The objective of this study was to evaluate the correlation between objective quantification of motor function of the median nerve using a load cell and findings from electrodiagnostic studies (EDS) in patients diagnosed with carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). The strength of thumb abduction and index finger flexion was measured three times in each hand and the average values were used to calculate thumb index ratio (TIR). The correlation between TIR and clinical, EDS and ultrasonographic findings were evaluated in 67 patients (119 hands) aged from 28 to 81 years. The results indicated that TIR was significantly lower in patients with preoperative nerve conduction grade, thenar atrophy and severe median nerve swelling on ultrasound (p<0.001, p<0.001 and p=0.042 respectively). It was concluded that measurements of median nerve motor function with a load cell is a valuable evaluation tool in CTS and might help detect subclinical motor dysfunction before muscle atrophy develops.", "label": "gpt3re"}
{"text": "\"Mexican Werewolf in Texas\" is not a werewolf movie after all - it's actually about a Chupacabra that's causing mayhem in the small town of Furlough, Texas. It seems the film title was changed by the distributors in order to earn more money, and it worked - that's why I ended up buying it. Needless to say, it wasn't much good - it was a low-budget horror film with bad dialogue, and terrible acting from most of the cast. The worst of them was the blond bimbo character - she was one of the worst actors I have ever seen (yes, even worse than \"Pterodactyl\"). Some of the shots in the movie were actually pretty decent, but most of them were dark, and the violence and gore was few and far between. The Chupacabra costume was pretty laughable, and it was obvious it was a guy in a suit. All in all, unless you're an absolute diehard fan of bad low-budget movies, it's not worth watching this movie alone. To fully appreciate it, watch it with friends and with beer.", "label": "gpt3re"}

{"text": "We investigate the relation between the Comptonization parameter (measured on the Planck 2013 nominally cleaned maps) and the X-ray luminosity (derived from ROSAT data), for 560 clusters with masses one order of magnitude smaller than that used by the Planck Collaboration. We also consider a redshift interval eight times larger than their interval. We show that the predicted signal of the non-self-similar model matches the anisotropies detected in the nominally cleaned Planck map in the X-ray emitting region, confirming the results of an earlier study. We further show that the universal pressure profile overestimates the signal between 15-21%, depending on the angular aperture, not due to the presence of cool-core systems, but rather owing to a break in the scaling relation towards low-mass systems. Additionally, the relation of the Comptonization parameter averaged over the region emitting 99% of the X-ray flux and the X-ray luminosity is found to be consistent with the expectations of the self-similar model. Lastly, we demonstrate that the scaling relations studied here do not evolve with redshift in the range probed by our catalog.", "label": "gpt3re"}

{"text": "For much of the Cold War, British governments tried to keep up with the arsenals of the superpowers. However, the US' sudden decision to discontinue nuclear cooperation with the UK at the end of World War II forced Britain to develop its own nuclear capabilities. Consequently, the UK had their first atomic device tested in 1952, followed by their first thermonuclear (hydrogen) bomb test in 1957 - a bluff that concealed their failure to make a powerful enough device. It was not until 1961 that the British had fully functional H-bombs. The challenge then shifted to delivery methods, so the UK designed their own missiles and turned to the US for help with the Skybolt ballistic missile, only to have the US scrap the project in 1962. Subsequently, the UK bought nuclear-equipped submarines and Polaris ballistic missiles, replacing them with the Trident programme in the 1990s. Overall, the military experienced some setbacks but was ultimately successful; US-UK nuclear co-operation was strengthened and the UK had a reliable and affordable nuclear force that they could use to their advantage in the post-Cold War world.", "label": "gpt3re"}

{"text": "Cyclotides are small proteins derived from plants that are genetically encoded as precursor proteins and then modified post-translationally to form circular cystine-knotted molecules. These molecules are able to resist enzymatic degradation and thus have a range of potential pharmaceutical applications. To find out how many different peptides a single plant specimen can express, scientists studied the transcriptome and cyclotide peptidome of a viola tricolor plant. This allowed them to identify precursor architecture and processing sites, and to characterize the cyclotide peptidome with mass spectrometry and bottom-up proteomics. Researchers discovered 164 cyclotides in the sample, leading them to suggest that violaceous plants globally may contain up to 150,000 individual cyclotides.

McQueen is cast, unfavored by the other criminals, as the novice with no criminal inclination who helps to plan the bank heist. Additionally, there's an insinuation of a gay relationship taking place between McQueen and David Clarke. Molly McCarthy, McQueen's female friend, also comes to an awareness of the brewing heist and becomes suspicious of the people Steve begins to hang around with; Crahan Denton, James Dukas, and David Clarke. This further aroused her suspicions. The Great St. Louis Bank Robbery was directed by Charles Guggenheim and John Stix; Guggenheim's experience is mainly in the realm of documentaries, and not much is known about Stix.

Results showed that 82 (56.6%) of the 145 patients had S122G yielding a resistance to simeprevir (NS3 protease inhibitor); 14 (10.1%) of the 148 patients had Y93H yielding a resistance to daclatasvir and ledipasvir (NS5A protein inhibitors); and 129 (94.2%) of the 137 patients had C316N yielding a resistance to sofosbuvir (NS5B polymerase inhibitor). Almost all of the DAA RAVs that were detected by ultra-deep sequencing could also have been identified by direct sequencing.

{"text": "The transport and flow of a transparent model fracture with rough, self-affine complementary walls with a relative shear displacement of @xmath0 is studied. It is revealed that the aperture field displays long-range correlations perpendicular to @xmath0. In particular, the width and geometry of the front when a dyed shear-thinning polymer solution displaces a transparent one is examined with respect to fluid rheology and flow velocity. It is observed that the front width increases linearly with distance, indicating convection of the fluids with low transverse mixing between flow paths. Additionally, the width rises with flow rate as the fluid rheology progresses from a Newtonian state at low-shear rates @xmath1 to a shear-thinning trait at higher @xmath1 values. Furthermore, the width increases with the polymer concentration at high flow rates. This demonstrates heightened velocity contrast between distinct flow channels for shear-thinning fluids. Theoretical models which consider the fracture as a collection of parallel ducts of constant hydraulic apertures correctly forecast the front widths for both low and high @xmath1 values for various polymer concentrations, as well as the overall shape of the experimental front geometry from an aperture map.", "label": "gpt3re"}

Examples of intracellular pathogens include viruses, Salmonella, Plasmodium falciparum, and Leishmania spp. Some bacteria, like Mycobacterium tuberculosis, have a protective capsule that prevents lysis by complement. Other bacteria elicit compounds that suppress or misdirect the host's immune response, like biofilms in chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Burkholderia cenocepacia infections associated with cystic fibrosis, or surface proteins that bind to antibodies and render them ineffective, like Streptococcus (protein G), Staphylococcus aureus (protein A), and Peptostreptococcus magnus (protein L).", "label": "gpt3re"}

I was impressed by how Gene Roddenberry managed to combine the original pilot in to a two-part episode. While the newer part of the narrative was mainly used as justification for Kirk and some other characters (and us) to observe the pilot, the idea of Spock being on trial is an impressive one. Despite the plot having a few inconsistencies, such as why it was necessary for Pike to be brought back to the Talosians' planet considering their brainwashing powers and Captain Pike's state, or the unanswered questions about Pike and Commodore Mendez, it is still something worth watching, enjoying the only two-parter in the Star Trek series.", "label": "gpt3re"}

{"text": "Since its inception, the Treaties were designed to permit people to achieve their aspirations in any EU country through freedom of movement. Initially, the European Community concentrated on the free movement of workers due to its economic nature as a \"factor of production\". Yet, starting in the 1970s, the focus changed towards creating a more \"social\" Europe. As opposed to previously being tied to economic activity, free movement began to be based around \"citizenship\", providing people with rights which would allow them to become economically and socially active. The \"worker\" rights in TFEU article 45 serve as a specific derivation of the general rights of citizens present in TFEU articles 18 to 21. The Court of Justice has established that a \"worker\" is any person who takes part in economic activities and is paid, either in money or as an \"indirect quid pro quo\". Once in possession of \"worker\" status, one is granted protection against any form of discrimination that comes from governments and employers in terms of employment access, tax, and social security rights. On the other hand, a citizen, who is a person having the nationality of a Member State (TFEU article 20(1)), is able to look for work, and is allowed to vote in local and European elections, though the social security rights are more restricted. In recent years, freedom of movement has become a highly sensitive issue as nationalistic political factions employ tactics of fear-mongering, spreading false claims that immigrants are taking away jobs and welfare. Nevertheless, numerous studies have confirmed that in reality, labour mobility has no notable effect on wages and employment of local workers.", "label": "gpt3re"}

{"text": "The Arts & Humanities as a subject area is inherently focused on the connection between human behavior and culture. This shared interest indicates that much of the research in the Arts & Humanities enables different fields to be connected, similar to how modern scientific research connects usually independent disciplines. One approach for exploring this multidisciplinarity of research is to analyze the citation links between journals when a paper in one is referencing a paper in the other. The Arts & Humanities landscape is rarely the center of bibliometric analysis, due to a fundamental focus of the bibliometric community on citation evaluation. Thus, examining the context of journals is one method for reading and understanding assignments within this subject area. Originality is a foremost requirement of scholarly work in this area as well as throughout all writing assignments. Plagiarism is a serious issue that applies not only to students, but to all writers and scholars. To protect against copying the work of another, using quotes and quoting accurately should be employed judiciously. Ultimately, plagiarism should be avoided at all costs in order to ensure that ideas presented are genuinely one's own.", "label": "gpt3re"}

{"text": "I rarely feel the need to write a review on this website, however, this film deserves a critique because of how unprofessionally it was created, and the apparent bias of its content. I believe there was a clear effort to portray the Palestinian family as boorish and untrustworthy. Despite the dialogue which touched upon the sorrow and oppression faced by the Palestinians, the film was presented in such a way that it made it seem as if the Jewish Israelis were the ones who were politically oppressed. No footage was presented that showed the plight of the Palestinian teenager, instead we only hear from Palestinian prisoners. Even though there are restrictions in place, the political motives behind them seem to hinder any sort of peace.I concluded the film feeling as if the mother of the victim was begrudging of her mourning; her close-mindedness and aggressive words caused the final meeting to descend into chaos. It would be more accurate to say that it is the Israeli mindset which is the root of the problem, as their pleas for justice and understanding and requests for recognition over their acquisition of land have been consistently ignored.I feel inclined to give the film a two-star rating due to the selfishness of the mother which, normally, would be commendable in a documentary; yet taking into account the lack of impartiality and the multitude of flaws, such as the abysmal editing and a dearth of background information and an adequate representation of the Palestinian side, the film barely passes muster.

{"text": "Despite Israel's attempts to provide resources to Palestinians, including 3,000 greenhouses, the opening of border crossings and the encouragement of trade, Gaza responded by destroying the greenhouses and electing a government they hoped would eradicate the Jews. As a result of this, thousands of rockets have been fired from Gaza into Israel, with Hamas taking advantage of the situation and digging tunnels beneath Israeli territories from which to launch surprise attacks. Additionally, Hamas purposefully targets Israeli civilians, even going so far as to place their weapons in schools, mosques, hospitals, and private homes in order to increase the likelihood of civilian casualties. In comparison, Israel arrested those guilty of murdering a Palestinian youth in 2014 and offered reparations to the victim's family - a move that Hamas neglected to do in response to the murder of three Israeli teenagers. Also, there are no Israeli soldiers actually based in Gaza, a point that many Hamas apologists have argued otherwise.The pro-Palestinian Left often fails to take into account the facts of the conflict and instead creates a narrative of strong oppressors and weak underdogs, which allows them to gain a sense of moral superiority by favoring the Palestinians. Leftists see Israel—a capitalist, conservative, and fiercely patriotic nation—as distillation of everything they detest from Western countries due to its values and the people it cherishes.

{"text": "Strong large-scale magnetic fields in galaxies are commonly thought to have been created by a mean field dynamo, which would require a large amount of time to generate the observed fields. Despite this, similar fields of equivalent intensity and scale to the one in our galaxy, have been seen in high redshift galaxies, meaning mean field dynamos would not have had enough time to generate the fields. Therefore, we research methods of creation of strong large-scale magnetic fields in the first objects of the universe due to the action of a turbulent, helical stochastic dynamo at redshifts @xmath0. Ambipolar drift plays an important part due to the low level of ionization of the gas, enabling a large stochastic dynamo to operate. We consider a variety of values for the parameters that characterize the turbulent plasma in order to account for the unknowns of high redshift objects.

After exiting in the European Challenge Cup quarter-finals last week, the season cannot end soon enough for the capital side. Edinburgh dominated possession and territory in the opening quarter, but failed to capitalize on some promising initial moments. Duncan Weir missed out on a penalty opportunity whilst the opposition drilled two successes. Following a few flashes of their usual verve, Connacht scored on their first visit to Edinburgh's 22. McKeon reached his destination with a short pass from Kieran Marmion and Crosbie followed up with a conversion, making the deficit 13-0. Weir ruined his second attempt, but Crosbie completed his trio of kick successfully to give the opposing team control at the break. The post-interval events replicated the first half, a few Edinburgh openings undone by errors. Crosbie slotted another penalty and Connacht almost scored their second try, but a pass was wasted in the right corner. Weir was fortunate not to get cautioned for a high tackle on Finlay Bealham, but Connacht were not as generous with a penalty penalty leading to three points. Edinburgh were able to rally and score two tries in a four-minute interval, creating hope despite an initially failed three-on-one opening.

The low-energy portion of the @xmath0- absorption cross section for the isotopic series of Kr, Xe, Ba, and Sm have been studied and well-reproduced, indicating that the Landau fragmentation of dipole strength and its redistribution caused by shape fluctuations determine the low-energy cross section. Lastly, the observed smooth energy dependence in the experiment is caused by collisional damping which wipes out fluctuations. In the case of semi-magic nuclei, shallow pygmy resonances have been found in agreement with the experimental data.", "label": "gpt3re"}

{"text": "We present the outcome of our thorough intranight optical surveillance of the well-known low-energy peaked bl lac (LBL) object PKS 0735+178. This long-term follow-up consists of @xmath0-band monitoring for a minimum duration of @xmath1 hours, spanning a period of 11 years (1998 - 2008) across 17 nights. Using a CCD N-Star photometer, a detection limit of roughly @xmath2 was attained for the intra-night optical variability (INOV). Unbelievably, an INOV amplitude of @xmath3 within an hour-long timescale was not seen on any of the 17 nights, despite the known likelihood of a typical LBL displaying such INOV levels in a session of @xmath4 hours being high ( @xmath5). Our observations thus present an unusual long-term INOV quiescence of this radio-selected bl lac object. Additionally, the availability of unpublished optical monitoring data of comparable high sensitivity, received in another program, allowed us to confirm the same anomalous INOV quiescence of this LBL all the way back to 1989, during its historically most powerful radio outburst. Here, we provide observational proof demonstrating the very strange INOV behavior of this classical bl lac object, and discuss this briefly in comparison to its other known unusual properties.

{"text": "A 70-year old postmenopausal woman presented at the Gimbie Adventist Hospital in Western Ethiopia with 3 weeks of vaginal bleeding. On examination, a dark moving worm was found attached to the cervical os. The diagnosis was hypovolumic shock and severe anemia secondary to postmenopausal vaginal bleeding. After stabilization with intravenous crystalloids, the leech was removed, and the patient was transfused with two units of whole blood. Upon discharge on the 3rd day post-procedure, the patient was in good condition and was prescribed ferrous sulfate. This case highlights that human leech infestation is a disease of the poor who live in rural areas and use contaminated water. Vagina can be infested by leeches when women use such water for bathing and/or douching, making it a rare but serious condition in postmenopausal women. To decrease morbidity, health care providers must consider the possibility of vaginal leech infestation in postmenopausal women from rural areas and users of river water for drinking, bathing, and/or douching who present with vaginal bleeding.

{"text": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of high-dose simvastatin on cerebral vasospasm and its clinical outcome following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) in Korean patients. The design of the study was a prospective observational cohort study. Subjects with aneurysmal SAH who had undergone aneurysm clipping or coiling were allocated to one of three groups: the 20 mg, 40 mg, and 80 mg simvastatin groups. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of symptomatic vasospasm while the clinical outcome was determined with the modified Rankin Scale (MRS) score after 1 month and 3 months. Logistic regression analysis was used to assess the risk factors of the development of vasospasm. 99 patients with aneurysmal SAH who were treated and screened were successively allocated to the 20 mg (n=22), 40 mg (n=34), and 80 mg (n=31) simvastatin groups. Symptomatic vasospasm occurred in 36.4% of the 20 mg group, 8.8% of the 40 mg group, and 3.2% of the 80 mg group (p=0.003). Multiple logistic regression analysis demonstrated that poor Hunt-Hess grades (OR=5.4, 95% CI =1.09-26.62) and high-dose (80 mg) simvastatin (OR=0.09 and 95% CI=0.1-0.85) were independent factors of symptomatic vasospasm.

{"text": "Unlike the majority of the reviewers, I was not born in the 1980s. I was born on May 14th 1994, however I was raised with an '80s lifestyle. When most other kids had playstations, I was playing Zelda on my NES. Even with me being only 15 when I wrote this review, the movie has a special place in my heart. This is because, having had an '80s childhood, I watched many TV shows and movies that other kids didn't and this was one of them. It was also one of the greatest. The movie starts in the home of Alvin Seville, Simon Seville, Theodore Seville and David Seville. Dave, the Chipmunks' adoptive father, is in a rush to get to the airport for a business trip around Europe. After a brief goodbye, Dave leaves them under the care of Miss Miller. Later, at a local café, the Chipmunks and Chipettes are playing a game of 'Around the world in 30 days'. After losing the game to Brittany, Alvin becomes engaged in a heated argument about who could really win a race around the world. Two diamond smugglers overhear their argument and seeing an appealing way of smuggling their diamonds around the world, decide to fool the children into delivering them for them. They offer a 100.000 dollar reward to the winning team and set off the race. However, due to the kids not facing any security checks or being questioned, it seems redundant as this creates a safe passage for the smugglers as much as if they had done it themselves. The incredible animation, top-notch voice acting, strong storyline and enjoyable music makes this classic movie a joy to watch. Songs like 'The Girls and Boys of Rock and Roll' and 'Getting Lucky' are amazing and memorable. Nancy Cartwright, who provides the voice of Bart Simpson, also makes an appearance in the film. In the end, the wrong-doers have been caught, loose ends have been tied and Dave, the chipmunks and Miss Miller drive off into the sunset. My nostalgic view of this classic from the '80s concludes my 10 out of 10 rating.", "label": "gpt3re"}
{"text": "If one is willing to overlook its historical inaccuracies, this film actually proves quite entertaining. It's got lots of action, adventure and romance - plus with the ever-impressive Errol Flynn and Olivia de Havilland as the leading pair, there's certainly no lack of quality. Upon further viewings, certain offbeat and comedic scenes are noticeable, e.g. Custer's arrival at West Point, Sharp's practical joke and the meetings with the tea reader, Callie (Hattie McDaniel, whose mannerisms seem to emulate Mantan Moreland's) - and the owl scene. Moreover, it is interesting to note that a year prior, Flynn starred alongside Ronald Reagan's General Custer and de Havilland as J.E.B. Stuart in \"Santa Fe Trail\". The two hours is well spent as we are able to gain insight into Custer's character. It is well worth seeing how he remained focused on reaching glory and not giving up to temptation. His loyalty to the men he led and his discipline is portrayed in his conversation with Sharp before he heads off to Little Big Horn. Plus, Custer's insightful remark on glory and his own destiny was an emotional highlight in the film: \"You take glory with you when it's your time to go.\"", "label": "gpt3re"}

{"text": "The objective of this study was to explore the potential mechanism behind the volumetric increase of omentum flaps harvested laparoscopically and used to reconstruct breasts. Histological samples were harvested before and after transposition of the omentum flap during two separate breast symmetrization surgeries in 8 patients. Changes in the cells' morphometric measurements, microvascular density (as measured by the presence of endothelial cells CD31), and immunohistochemical expression of VEGF were all documented. Increases in adipocyte size and microvascular density were statistically significant (p<0.012). The expression levels of VEGF were lower in the second set of samples, but the difference was not statistically significant (p<0.093). These results show an increase in the sizes of the cells, suggesting that hypertrophy from neoangiogenesis may have caused the increase in VEGF expression in the flap. Furthermore, the increase in microvessels may have been caused by the initial higher expression of VEGF.", "label": "gpt3re"}

Here, we present deep submm observations at 870@xmath2 m with LABOCA that were taken shortly after a maximum in the 5.5-year radio cycle. We found a significant difference in the submm flux measured here compared to the previous measurement, providing the first indication of variability at submm wavelengths. A comparison of the submm structure with ionised emission features reveals that the 870@xmath2 m wavelength is dominated by emission from the ionised wind and not thermal emission from dust. We estimate @xmath3 of dust surrounding @xmath1 Carinae. The spatial distribution of the submm emission indicates that the mass loss has occurred within the last thousand years related to mass ejected during the great eruptions and the pre-outburst LBV wind phase; we estimate @xmath1 Carinae has ejected @xmath4 of gas within this timescale.

{"text": "Recent research by Denve and colleagues has suggested that the precise timing of spikes may be crucial in how neural networks compute. This is in contrast to the traditional model of computing by neural networks, where the focus is on population firing rates and firings are assumed to be random. With the spike-based approach, each neuron’s firing is used to reduce the error in the network’s output in order to carry out linear computations. A potential problem with this approach, however, is that biophysically realistic networks with subthreshold nonlinearity and slower synaptic timescales may not fit into the framework. In response to this, it has been shown that the spike-based method can be extended to include these networks. This has been proven to demonstrate a number of key features of cortical networks, such as irregular and Poisson-like spike times and a balance between excitation and inhibition. It will also show how the behavior of the model can be scaled up with the number of neurons recorded, increasing the biological plausibility of the spike-based approach to network computation.", "label": "gpt3re"}

{"text": "The majority of Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs), including Cystitis and Pyelonephritis, are caused by Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC). This leads to a breach of the mucosal barrier of the normally sterile urinary tract, thus triggering an inflammatory response from the host, including cytokine production, neutrophil influx, and the exfoliation of infected bladder epithelial cells. Furthermore, UPEC activates various signaling pathways, including pathways known to activate the innate immune response, in combination with calcium-dependent signaling pathways. Despite several host defense mechanisms, some UPEC isolates are able to suppress the activation of components of the innate host response, leading to the persistence of UPEC in the urinary tract and recurrent infections. For successful prevention of UTIs and associated complications, the molecular details of these events must be studied.", "label": "gpt3re"}

It is often used in sweet dishes, such as those created by Michelin-stared chef Anne-Sophie Pic with chocolate, or added to recipes from celebrity chef Wolfgang Puck. The pepper, which comes from Madagascar, has an intense heat and lingering citrusy taste. It can now be found in various spice stores across the UK. It remains a rare ingredient, however, with its consumption still very limited and even a small number of people in Madagascar having used it extensively. There are people, such as Olivier Ramaherison, who are advocating for the pepper to become more popular, to the degree of the common black pepper we use today. He has created the first Tsiperifery farm in Madagascar and is employing people with the aim of protecting the island's forest, whilst also attempting to control the tsiperifery market.

Further, an algorithm is provided that allows for deciding realizability for the discussed formalisms and related semantics, providing also a method for constructing a desired knowledge base if one exists. The algorithm is structured in a modular form, allowing for easy extension to additional formalisms and related semantics.

Particularly, the free-floating planetary mass object OTS44 (M9.5, ~0.012 Jupiter masses, age ~2 Myr), which was discovered to have significant accretion and a substantial disk, shows strong, broad, and variable Paschen $\\alpha$ emission, indicating the active accretion of a free-floating planet. This study further shows that the mass-accretion rate for objects ranging from 14 solar masses down to 0.01 solar masses unifies at a ratio of disk-to-central mass of ~1%. As such, the analysis of OTS44 suggests that it is formed in a star-like mode, and that the increasing population of young free-floating planets and ultra-cool T and Y field dwarfs are the low-mass extension of the stellar population.", "label": "gpt3re"}

{"text": "Based on the utilitarian principle of optimizing the greatest good for the greatest number, economic inequality is seen as a problem. The associated decreased \"distributive efficiency\" within society diminishes the marginal utility of wealth, thus reducing the sum total of personal utility. To demonstrate this idea, an opulent home for a millionaire may offer less utility than it would for a family of five without housing. In addition, an additional dollar spent by a poorer person will most likely go towards necessary items providing more utility than a more expensive item for the richer person. This demonstrates how the marginal utility of wealth per individual decreases with more wealth. Studies have found lower inequality in certain societies to be linked to higher overall satisfaction and happiness levels. All of this indicates that for any particular amount of wealth in society, a more equal society will lead to a greater total utility.", "label": "gpt3re"}
{"text": "We present Chandra ACIS X-ray observations of the Galactic supernova remnant Cassiopeia A taken in December 2007. By combining these data with previous Chandra archival observations from 2000, 2002, and 2004, we found the Shock velocity range at various points around the outermost shell to be between 4200 and 5200 km/s. In order to construct a model for the evolution of Cas A, we used our results in addition to previous analyses of Cas A's X-ray emission. We found that its expansion is effectively fit by a ejecta profile running into a circumstellar wind. Moreover, while the position of the reverse shock was consistent with the one measured in the X-rays, we had to assume that roughly 30% of the total explosion energy had been used in accelerating cosmic rays at the forward shock in order to match the forward shock velocity and radius. The new X-ray images also showed brightness variations in some forward shock filaments, similar to a few nonthermal filaments located inside the remnant. Spectral fits to exterior forward shock filaments and interior nonthermal filaments revealed that they display similar spectra. This along with the same flux variations leads us to believe that the interior nonthermal filaments may just be forward shock filaments that are seen in projection and not located at the reverse shock, as has been recently proposed.", "label": "gpt3re"}

{"text": "A closed set of analytical expressions for scattering intensity and global structure factors have been derived for a newly solvable model of polydisperse sticky hard spheres. This model is based on the exact solution of the \"mean spherical approximation\" for hard core plus Yukawa potentials with an infinite amplitude and vanishing range of the attractive tail, but with a constant product of the two. The selection of a factorable coupling (stickiness) parameter in the Yukawa term results in a more simplistic \"dyadic structure\" in the Fourier transform of the Baxter factor correlation function@xmath0, offering simplifications in all structure factors as compared to prior works. The impact of size and stickiness polydispersity are analyzed, as are numerical results for two separate versions of the model: i) in which all polydisperse particles have the same, size-independent stickiness parameter, or ii) when the stickiness parameters are proportional to the diameters. It is also noted that two different regimes for the average structure factor exist above and below a generalized Boyle temperature that depends on size polydispersity. Because of its analyticity and simplicity, this model may be applied to interpretation of small-angle scattering experimental data for polydisperse colloidal fluids of neutral particles with surface adhesion.", "label": "gpt3re"}

These patients were then compared to reference groups of healthy controls and other chronic patients with regards to depression and anxiety, psychological distress, coping, social support, and self-efficacy. Associations between psychosocial characteristics and fatigue were also calculated. Results showed that compared to the healthy controls, patients with PSF had more psychological distress, less problem-focused coping, and more positive social support.

Elie Prioleau in 1685 who founded the first Huguenot church in North America. Notable Huguenots of Norman and Carolingian nobility include Edmund Bohun of Suffolk, England, Jean Postell of Dieppe, France, Alexander Pepin, Antoine Poitevin of Orsement, and Jacques de Bordeaux of Grenoble. After petitioning the British Crown for their rights to own land in the Baronies, they prospered as slave-owners on the estates they bought from the Landgrave Edmund Bellinger on the Cooper, Ashepoo, Ashley and Santee River.

{"text": "Peptide antibiotics have the capacity to effectively combat invading microorganisms and enhance the body's natural defense mechanisms. Examples of these human antimicrobial peptides, such as Human Neutrophil Peptides (HNPs), Human -Defensins (HBds), and Cathelicidin (LL-37) have powerful bactericidal activity against both Gram - Negative and Gram - Positive bacteria, while additionally being able to act as immunomodulators by stimulating cytokine, chemokine production, inflammation, and activating immune cells. Neutrophils, which play a key role in defending against microbial infection, have their lifespans regulated by a combination of pathogens and host-derived substances. It is suggested that HNP-1, HBD-3, and LL-37 can not only destroy, but also modulate (inhibit) neutrophil apoptosis. This is assumed to be the result of phosphorylation of ERK-1/-2, the downregulation of TBid (an proapoptotic protein) and upregulation of Bcl-xl (an antiapoptotic protein), as well as the suppression of mitochondrial membrane potential change and caspase 3 activity. It has been hypothesised that the distinct receptors, such as the P2Y6 nucleotide receptor, the chemokine receptor CCR6, and the low - affinity formyl - peptide receptor FPRL1/the nucleotide receptor P2X7, may be involved in the process. A suppression of neutrophil apoptosis prolongs their lifespan aiding the body's defense against bacterial infection.", "label": "gpt3re"}

{"text": "In July 1993, Yugoslavia was weakened economically by regional war and, in an attempt to utilize the savings of its citizens, began to print money and create restrictive measures for government banks. The result was a drastic increase in the inflation rate and the government's attempt to control prices only caused manufacturers to stop producing essential goods. This led to a situation in which bakeries were no longer making bread. In 2008, a similar situation occurred in Zimbabwe where their civil war had depleted the country's treasury. President Mugabe took and redistributed land and other assets from white farmer resulting in food exports dropping and more money being printed. Other components of the economic collapse included wages being unable to keep up with inflation, hospitals and schools having staffing problems, and the government failing to pay bills for water treatment and transport, making prices double every 24 hours. Though there exist many other cases, the above provides a good overview of the problems leading to economic turmoil and hyperinflation.", "label": "gpt3re"}
{"text": "The use of photonic microsystems has been integral in the development of integrated photonic devices due to their capabilities in precise spatiotemporal control and spectral shaping. However, attempts to achieve the same with x-ray radiation are practically impossible as they require the massive size of silicon single-crystal optics to be utilized. In this paper, we demonstrate the use of micromechanical systems as an alternative approach to x-ray optics. These microsystems can be used to maintain the wavefront properties with near 100% reflectivity and create nanosecond timing windows with more than 100-khz frequency. This makes them perfect for incorporation into lab-based and next-generation synchrotron x-ray sources, granting unprecedented design flexibility for future dynamic and compact x-ray optics for focusing, wavefront modification, multi-colour dispersion, and pulse slicing.", "label": "gpt3re"}
{"text": "The encompassing term 'geodynamo' is used to refer to the processes in Earth's liquid outer core that give rise to its magnetic field. In the last few decades, great effort has been made to simulate these processes using magnetohydrodynamic equations. However, there are several control parameters in these numercial models that are different from those found in Earth's core. Observed scaling laws for certain parameters like heat transport, flow velocity, magnetic field strength and magnetic dissipation time have been generated. To understand these scalings at a deeper level, 116 numerical dynamo models from Christensen and co-workers were subjected to leave-one-out cross-validation. In contrast to previous results, we found that diffusion processes are not insignificant for the velocity and strength of the magnetic field in the numercial models. Moreover, the scaling of the magnetic dissipation time is more complex than initially assumed. If processes in the numercial models are assumed to be similar to those found in the Earth's core, a core ohmic dissipation of 3-8 TW can be estimated through this scaling. This value is consistent with recent high CMB heat flux scenarios.", "label": "gpt3re"}
{"text": "The Indian action thriller Ab Tak Chhappan follows Sadhu Agashe, a dedicated and hard-edged police officer leading a plain clothed crime squad who makes a name for himself by killing criminals in staged police encounters rather than sending them to prison. This loyalty gains him the respect of his officers, but Imtiaz, another of his squad, grows jealous of Sadhu and competes with him for criminal kills. The story further complicates as a new police commissioner disapproves of Sadhu's tactics, leading to internal politics and new recruit to join his squad. Though this film is not based on reality, Shimit Amin's directing, camera work, acting, and tension create the sensation of being a real fly-on-the-wall in the drama.

{"text": "It has been demonstrated that there is a strong link between the rate of decrease in rotation speed and the shape of the pulse for six pulsars and between the rate of decrease in rotation speed and the potency of the flux density for three others. It is likely that these correlations can be attributed to alterations in the electric currents of the pulsar magnetosphere. In this paper, we review these reports, now including 16 pulsars with synchronized slowdown rates and pulse emission attributes. It appears that these changes may be due to the abrupt transition between two distinct magentospheric structures under the well-documented mode-switching and pulse-nulling processes. We also discuss how common these occurrences are among the entirety of the pulsar population.", "label": "gpt3re"}
{"text": "The 25a system promotes the antiviral effect of interferons by triggering the activity of ribonuclease, RNase L, which breaks down viral and cellular RNA after being activated by 25 phosphodiester-linked, oligoadenylates [(pp)p5a2(p5a2)]n, n 2. We researched the potential role of RNase L in apoptosis, since both the 25a system and apoptosis serve as antiviral defense mechanisms and RNA degradation happens with both. Overexpression of human RNase L through an inducible promoter in NIH3t3 fibroblasts decreased cell viability and led to apoptosis, while activation of endogenous RNase L, either through 25a or with dsRNA, prompted apoptosis. Furthermore, blocking RNase L with a dominant negative mutant quelled poly (I)poly (C)-induced apoptosis in interferon-primed fibroblasts and inhibition of RNase L stopped apoptosis caused by poliovirus. These results suggest that increased levels of RNase L lead to apoptosis and inhibition of RNase L activity hinders viral-triggered apoptosis, making apoptosis one of the antiviral mechanisms regulated by the 25a system.", "label": "gpt3re"}

Not only does greater inequality hinder economic growth, but high and long-term unemployment, which typically causes inequality to rise, also has a detrimental effect on the growth of future economies. This can be attributed to wasted resources, just as well as various other contributing factors such as the redistribution of wealth, the deepening of poverty, the restriction of liquidity and labor mobility, and a decrease in individual self-confidence leading to social disruption, agitation and conflict. Consequently, policies geared towards controlling unemployment, especially those that decrease inequality-driven effects, are likely to bolster economic growth.", "label": "gpt3re"}

We find that the combination of adiabatic and isocurvature modes is mildly better fitting to the current data than the pure adiabatic modes, with the minimum Xmath0 being reduced by Xmath1. We also obtain a stringent limit on the fraction of CDM isocurvature contributions, which is less than Xmath2 at Xmath3 confidence level. With the presence of isocurvature modes, the adiabatic spectral index is slightly raised to Xmath4, and the tilt for isocurvature spectrum can be large, with the best fit value of Xmath5. Finally, we discuss the effect on WMAP normalization priors, shift parameter Xmath6, acoustic scale Xmath7 and Xmath8 from CDM isocurvature perturbation and find that the mean values of Xmath6, Xmath7, and Xmath8 can change by Xmath9, Xmath10 and Xmath11 respectively, compared to those found in the pure adiabatic condition.", "label": "gpt3re"}

In 1805, Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac and Alexander von Humboldt established that water consists of two volumes of hydrogen and one volume of oxygen; and by 1811 Amedeo Avogadro correctly analyzed water's composition, based on what is now known as Avogadro's law and the notion that elemental molecules are diatomic.", "label": "gpt3re"}
{"text": "Steam engines typically have two different mechanisms in place to make sure that the pressure in the boiler does not get too high; the first of which can be adjusted by the user and the second usually serves as a last resort. Traditional safety valves use a lever to keep a plug valve in the boiler from rising due to steam pressure. One end of the lever is usually made of a spring or a weight to keep it from opening too much. Past safety valves could be altered by engine operators, often leading to serious issues when a driver would tighten the valve to obtain more power from the engine. To rectify this issue, newer models of safety valves utilize an adjustable spring-loaded valve that is locked, so that the user can not change the settings without breaking a seal. This is seen as much safer.", "label": "gpt3re"}

A flow cytometry method was employed to examine the cells of 52 PSS and 28 healthy control subjects. It was found that the absolute count of CD3+ T cell population was lower in PSS patients. Significant differences were seen between PSS patients with SSA/SSB antibodies and controls in the proportions and absolute counts of CD4+ T cells. However, no differences were detected between the CD4+ and CD8+ Treg subpopulations. The proportions and absolute counts of Th17 cells were significantly lower in PSS patients. Similarly, a decrease in absolute counts of CD8+ T cells and an impaired proportion and absolute count of CD8+ subpopulations according to CD27+ and CD57+ were detected. Additionally, NK and NKT cells decreased in PSS with abs, and b cells proportion was increased in blood of PSS with abs. It is possible that the distribution impairment of these cells is due to genetic lymphopenia or lymphocyte migration from periphery to inflammatory sites or/and increased susceptibility to apoptosis.", "label": "gpt3re"}

Results indicate that 15% of these adolescents have given birth, with marriage, dropping out of school, and negative peer and family models associated with early childbearing for those aged 15-17. For 18-19 year-olds, school attendance postpones motherhood while marriage accelerates it. Older adolescents with higher social and individual control were more likely to delay motherhood. Suggestions to reduce risky behaviors and improve sexual and reproductive health outcomes of adolescent girls in Nairobi slums are given. These findings reinforce the high contribution of adolescent childbearing to fertility rates in many sub-Saharan African countries compared to other parts of the world.", "label": "gpt3re"}

Unlike Newtonian fluids which increase monotonically, the fluid-plate contact area oscillates in an unpredictable manner. Furthermore, the instability of the periphery resembles Saffman-Taylor fingers which is unusual under compression. Additionally, the loading history has an effect on the degree of spreading.

{"text": "Measles is a highly contagious disease that induces severe, though temporary, immunosuppression. Signaling lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAM) is normally expressed on cells of the immune system and serves as a receptor for measles virus (MV). Vaccine MV strains are also known to use the ubiquitously expressed CD46 as a receptor, while wild-type (WT) strains of MV do not. Recent studies however have indicated that SLAM may not be the only receptor for WT MV strains, as it was found to have the intrinsic ability to access both immune and epithelial cells through separate binding sites on its hemagglutinin (H) protein. The epithelial MV receptor, Nectin4, was recently identified as being expressed at adherens junctions, providing a more complete knowledge of the MV receptors. It was determined that MV specifically targets two cell types - immune and epithelial - through SLAM and Nectin4 respectively. When the MV possesses specific mutations in its H protein, it loses the ability to use either SLAM or Nectin4, yet still infects SLAM-positive immune cells efficiently and Nectin4-positive epithelial cells respectively (dual-tropic). In spite of many unknown aspects and pathways involving immunosuppressive effects and the highly contagious nature of MV, the investigation of physiological function of the two receptors may illuminate more of its pathogenesis.", "label": "gpt3re"}
{"text": "The purpose of this study was to investigate whether antimicrobial blue light (ABL) could be an effective alternative or adjunctive therapeutic for infectious keratitis. Ex vivo and in vivo animal models with a bioluminescent strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were used as the causative pathogen in order to noninvasively monitor the extent of infection in real time. ABL (415 nm) was delivered to infected corneas at 6 or 24 hours post inoculation. Bacterial burden in the infected corneas was found to be reduced significantly by a single dose of ABL both ex vivo and in vivo. However, the recurrence of infection was observed after 24 hours in the ABL-treated mice. Additionally, the ABL toxicity to the retina was highly dependent on the transmission capability of the cornea. The results of this study suggest that ABL may be a potential alternative or adjunctive therapeutic for infectious keratitis. Further studies involving large animal models with ocular anatomies similar to humans should be carried out to assess the safety of both the cornea and the retina.", "label": "gpt3re"}

The renowned Associated Independent Records (AIR) Studios Montserrat quickly became the choice destination for a who's who of top musicians during the 1980s, recording now iconic albums such as The Police's Synchronicity and Dire Straits' Brothers in Arms. Yvonne Kelly, who served as managing director of the studios from 1981 to 1989, reflects on how working at the studio \"changed my world and my life.\" After discovering the job opportunity in her hometown of Doncaster and being familiar with Montserrat, she moved to the island and started a restaurant before being hired by Martin. Aside from the breathtaking experience of working at the studio, Kelly also thanks him for introducing the world to Montserrat. Even after the studio was forced to close due to Hurricane Hugo in 1989, Martin maintained an important bond with the island, and even charitably raised funds in light of the 1997 volcanic eruption. She reflectively remarks: \"You could say George Martin was integral to the island and to why it became so popular. I am forever grateful to have known him and his family.

{"text": "Recently, some have advocated for carrying out randomized controlled trials to compare RFA (Radiofrequency Ablation) and Hepatic Resection, especially for patients with only a few small metastases. This retrospective review, conducted between January 1998 and May 2007, included 58 patients who underwent hepatic resection and 43 who had RFA. It was found that the 5-year survival rate after resection was 43%, while that after RFA was only 23%. For patients with solitary lesions, the 5-year survival rate was 48% after resection and 15% after RFA. In addition, 60% of patients who had RFA suffered from local recurrences compared to that of only 7% after hepatic resection. The results of this study clearly demonstrate that RFA is inferior to resection, supporting the consensus that RFA cannot be regarded as an equivalent procedure to hepatic resection.", "label": "gpt3re"}

Mrs Booth's spokesman revealed that the businesswoman had received death threats, although they have not been reported to police. The same day, the High Court in London dismissed a winding-up order brought by Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs, after the club paid off its £200,000 tax bill last month. The money was raised through a combination of loans and donations and the struggle to resolve the club's ownership remains. Mrs Booth has been connected to the potential takeover of Wrexham Football Club for several months, after the announcement in January by owners Geoff Moss and Ian Roberts that they were both stepping down from the board. Several bidders have since then shown their interest, including former footballer Ashley Ward and businessman Stephen Cleeve. Although Mrs Booth and the trust had declared their intention to work together, their current arrangement has quickly unraveled. Last month Wrexham successfully paid off the £200,000 tax bill, meaning the team were able to compete in the end-of-season promotion play-offs, but Tuesday's defeat to Luton dashed all hopes of a Football League return. In a statement to BBC Radio Wales, Mrs Booth said that when she first launched her bid for the club she had the financing in place. She accused the Trust of refusing to discuss the details of her proposal and revealed that they are currently meeting with two property developers, whom she claims have no connections to Wrexham. Her plan included putting the club and its assets, such as the Racecourse and Colliers Park, into community ownership, suggesting that it could generate revenue outside of just football. Spencer Harris, board member of WST, expressed disappointment at Mrs Booth's statements made to the press and clarified that WST have only received summary outline proposals. He said that WST are willing to speak to anyone who has the well-being of Wrexham in mind and will clarify their stance further at a public meeting on Tuesday at the William Aston Hall.", "label": "gpt3re"}

{"text": "Rest frame Strömgren photometry (3500, 4100, 4750 and 5500) has been conducted on 509 galaxies in 17 rich clusters between redshift 0 and 1. This test confirms a strong Butcher-Oemler effect, which states that the fraction of blue galaxies that is present rises from 20% at z=0 to 80% at z=1. Color criteria indicate that most of these blue galaxies are composed of regular disk or post-starburst systems. Comparison of our colors to the morphological results from Hubble Space Telescope imaging reveals that these blue galaxies are most likely late-type, LSB objects that wither and are eventually destroyed by the cluster tidal field. Segregation of the red objects from the Butcher-Oemler objects followed the comparison of the mean color of these old, non-star forming objects with models from the literature. This comparison confirms that single burst models are accurate in predicting an average epoch of galaxy formation at z=2.

To study the impacts of isotropic viscosity and heat conduction on the propagation of MHD waves, we derive the dispersion relations in two cases - with and without the parallel heat conduction. Our findings show that the wave dissipation is highly dependent on viscosity for the modified acoustic and Alfven Waves - with energy flux density changing from @xmath0 to @xmath1 and @xmath2 respectively. It is also suggested that the parallel heat conduction gives rise to abnormal dispersion, wherein the group velocity for waves exceeds the speed of light in vacuum. These waves are likely to contribute to the heating of coronal plasma, as well as provide a further accelerating agent for the fast solar wind in NPCH.", "label": "gpt3re"}

Thirty type 1 diabetic children with DKA were assessed with a twelve-lead electrocardiography (ECG) both prior to and following recovery. Results revealed that QTC and QTD mean values were significantly reduced after the recovery from DKA (p < 0.01). Sixteen patients (53.3%) had prolonged QTC during DKA (range 45 - 1538 ms) as compared to only one patient after recovery. Similarly, nineteen patients (63.3%) had prolonged QTD (>50ms) before recovery as compared to only three afterwards. The fact that three patients had normal QTC but prolonged QTD suggests that QTD may be a better marker for assessing cardiac risk in these patients. Anion gap was significantly associated with QTC and QTD prolongation (p < 0.0001) and patients had no electrolyte abnormalities or hypoglycemia to account for prolongation of either. In conclusion, prolonged QTC and QTD are frequently observed in DKA and are positively correlated to ketosis. This emphasizes the need for cardiac monitoring of patients with DKA.", "label": "gpt3re"}

Although Saskia agrees that Western societies are becoming increasingly narcissistic, she contests the claim that anorexia is a product of narcissism, instead asserting that weight loss is only a symptom of the underlying mental illness. According to her, the illness is caused by a need for control in a culture of superficial freedom. Susan Morris (not her real name) was diagnosed with anorexia when she was 19 years old, triggered by a traumatic family event. This was followed by an obsession with calories, exercise and body weight, acting as a means of distraction from her pain.

In addition, we express the Fourier transform of the joint probability density of the process to attain given values at several different times and to attain a given maximal value in a given time period through Fourier transforms of the jump intensity. Then, we consider a portfolio composed of stocks and options on stocks and derive the Fourier transform of a random variable @xmath1 (deviation of the portfolio) that is defined as a small temporal change of the portfolio diminished by the compound interest earned. Lastly, we derive a functional equation for the price of the option on the stock as a function of the stock subject to the condition that the deviation of the portfolio has a zero mean @xmath2 = 0$, thereby finding a solution to the option pricing problem.", "label": "gpt3re"}

Types of CVCs used in Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs) include Umbilical Venous Catheters, Peripherally Inserted Central Catheters and Tunneled Catheters. CRBSI is characterized as a laboratory-confirmed Bloodstream Infection (BSI) with a positive Catheter Tip Culture or a positive Blood Culture from the CVC. Usually, BSI is brought about by Gram-positive Cocci, Coagulase-negative Staphylococci and, at times, Gram-negative Organisms.

While the spin dynamics of spin-@xmath0 systems in CPMG-like experiments are well understood, it can still be hard to identify the desired pathways in the spectrum of unwanted coherences. In this paper, we use phase incremented echo train acquisition (PIETA) to perform MRPI, demonstrating how it provides an effective phase cycling scheme and thus allowing a better comprehension of undesired pathways.", "label": "gpt3re"}

{"text": "Since 2014, the Hepatitis C Trust has taken in £200,000 in grant funding from the US drug company Gilead. Last year, they unsuccessfully tried to challenge NHS England's policy of restricting access to said medicine due to cost concerns. While the charity denied that the funding from the drugs industry influenced their decision-making process, they maintained that their actions were in the best interests of the patients. In 2016, the charity took High Court action against NHS England for their decision to limit the availability of newly developed medicines for hepatitis C, which are estimated to be 95% effective at curing the disease in 8 weeks as opposed to the previous year-long injections that had many damaging side effects. The new drug, titled Sovaldi and manufactured by Gilead had a list price of £34,983, although there was a confidential deal with the NHS. In response, the health watchdog NICE deemed it cost-effective. However, the NHS set a limit of 10,000 people having access to the drug per year, increasing to 15,000 by 2021. While this is in place in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland do not have such restrictions. Gilead and other pharmaceutical companies developing treatments for hepatitis C were listed as \"interested parties\" to the court case. Evidence showed that in 2016 the Trust received £334,700 from five drug companies which was 35% of their total income, and £108,825 from Gilead alone. Other charities and patient groups have expressed worry at such high funding from the same drug companies whose medicine they are seeking to make more accessible, and some refrain from taking any funds from the pharmaceutical industry. The case was unsuccessful and Mr Justice Blake ruled that the limit was valid as it would save the lives of the most serious cases first. Though Gilead denied contributing money to the legal case, the charity maintained that they were doing what was right for the patients and not influenced by either the NHS or the drug industry. Gilead stated that their treatments are value for money and they hope to reduce mortality while also mitigating the financial burden to the NHS.", "label": "gpt3re"}

However, Donald Tusk, the President of the European Council, refused to meet with her, claiming it was not the right time. Nonetheless, a gathering with Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker was organised. When Ms Sturgeon is talking with European leaders, what is she seeking? There isn't a plan for some type of exceptional plan that could somehow protect Scotland's place in the EU. Plus, Scotland and the UK cannot have dissimilar relations if they are part of the same country. Ms Sturgeon made palpable that if a second referendum on Scottish independence is the only way for Scotland to stay in the EU, that is what she will do. Her goal for today is to remind the EU that Scotland voted to remain, declaring that Scotland \"did not let them down\" as Alyn Smith, an SNP MEP, indicated yesterday. Also, she is asking that Scotland is granted special consideration while Brexit negotiations occur. In addition, Ms Sturgeon is making it known that Scotland may soon become an independent country trying to stay in or rejoin the EU under the best conditions conceivable.

The relative blood vessel area was evaluated using the Chalkley counting method in each histologic subtype of the tumours, and the degree of proliferation of blood vessel endothelium was calculuated by dividing CD105-Chalkley score by CD31-Chalkley score. Significantly higher peritumoral and intratumoral blood vessel areas were found in SCC compared to BCC (with both CD31 and CD105), and the Chalkley counts differed significantly between groups with different BCC histologic subtypes and SCCs with different grades of differentiation. Surprisingly, a higher degree of proliferation of blood vessel endothelium was found in BCC compared to SCC.

Spectroscopic and in vitro inhibitory data point towards two potential helical formations leading to two distinctAMP-LPS binding mechanisms. Mechanism One features a helical binding conformation where AMP binds LPS tightly and is not transported across the LPS bilayer, hindering inhibitory activity. Mechanism Two depicts a helical formation formed as AMP binds LPS loosely and is easily conveyed across the LPS bilayer, augmenting inhibitory activity.

This is due to the fact that as the poor in society become richer, their yearly carbon emissions tend to increase. It should still be taken into account however, that under circumstances of large economic inequality, waste and pollution may not be any more prevalent, as the waste/pollution is then cleaned up more effectively (water treatment, filtering, etc.). It is worth noting as well that the influence of economic inequality on the amount of environmental degradation is dependent on the multiplier of population growth; the greater the number of people, the higher the multiplier and thus, the greater the environmental degradation.

The two marry despite knowing little about each other, soon after which Fonda displays dangerous signs of jealousy. Stanwyck gets mad but is unable to stay mad at him. Through magical thinking, the couple's issues seem to resolve when Fonda gets a job and then buys a hospital giving Stanwyck a job there. However, this film is a creepy little tale that seemingly excuses domestic violence and delusional jealousy.", "label": "gpt3re"}
{"text": "This classic Western movie doesn't rely on Hollywood stars or fancy effects--the cast is full of talented ordinary folks, telling a realistic story about the life of a rodeo hustler in the '60s and '70s West. Kudos to Slim Pickens, whose character went far beyond his former job as a rodeo clown, allowing him to explore the hard realities and psychological challenges of this tough lifestyle. His chemistry with co-star James Coburn works both within and outside the corral setting. An enjoyable supporting role by Anne Archer adds authentic Native American flavor to the second half of the movie. Overall, it holds its own with other classic Westerns like \"Junior Bonner,\" using a down-to-earth approach to tell a moving and poignant story. Encore Western Channel does an excellent job of bringing this timeless under-rated movie to its viewers.", "label": "gpt3re"}
{"text": "Multicellular helminths are regarded as knowledgeable regulators of immunity owing to their proficiency at evading host defence and setting up chronic infection. As soon as the host and parasite initially encounter each other, a cross-talk process at the molecular level influences the innate as well as acquired arms of the immune system. Dendritic cells' performance can be modulated by helminths, resulting in immunosuppression, mediated by a regulatory network which involves regulatory T cells, regulatory B cells and alternatively activated macrophages. In so doing, helminths can reduce or control both parasite-specific and unrelated inflammations in the host, such as TH1-mediated autoimmune and TH2-mediated hypersensitivity reactions. Although, certain helminths can however promote or intensify allergic responses. In this paper, the cell types that are crucial in helminth-modulated immunoregulation, the influence on inflammatory conditions, and the opposite impacts of toxocara and trichinella exposure on hypersensitivity reactions are discussed.", "label": "gpt3re"}

{"text": "Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OSCC) is the sixth largest type of malignancies in the world and the most prevalent type of cancer in the Indian Subcontinent. Despite advancements in treatment and therapeutic techniques, the 5-year survival rate for OSCC has remained below 40% for the last few decades. Studies have attempted to define molecular markers that could enable the early detection or predicting of the patient's outcome, however, these markers are still yet to be defined. Keratins, epithelia predominant intermediate filament proteins expressed in a differentiation dependent and site-specific manner, have been employed as biomarkers in a range of epithelial disorders, including cancer. Subsequent studies have indicated their association with desmoplakin and 64 integrin, components of desmosomes and hemidesmosomes, respectively. The present study examined the alterations in keratins and associated proteins during 4-Nitroquinoline 1-Oxide induced sequential stages of rat lingual mucosa carcinogenesis. Various signs, like the elevation of keratins 5/6a, ectopic expression of keratin 8, increased levels of suprabasal expression of 64 integrin and desmoplakin, were noted from dysplastic changes in the lingual epithelium and onward. Furthermore, the majority of these alterations were found to persist until the development of Suprabasal Cell Carcinoma, except for desmoplakin levels, which decreased in papillomatous and SCC. Remarkably, many of the alterations were similar to those observed in human oral carcinogenesis. This study thus suggests that the 4NQO model of rat lingual carcinogenesis reproduces key changes seen in human oral carcinogenesis and can be used to develop biomarkers.", "label": "gpt3re"}

Sir Keir Starmer, former Director of Public Prosecutions for England and Wales, released a report in May focused on three incidents linked to the claimed rape of Máiría Cahill. Cahill alleges an IRA member raped her when she was 16 and accused the PPS and police of failing to inspect her claims correctly.

{"text": "This study was conducted to assess the impact of bone quality and surgical procedure on the Implant Stability Quotient (ISQ) value. Additionally, the finite element analysis was performed to measure the effect of interfacial bone quality, close to the implant fixture, on the resonance frequency of the structure. To do this, two different groups of type 1 and type 2 pig rib bones were extracted and cut. In each type of bone, the same implants were installed following three diverse methods – compaction, self-tapping, and tapping. The ISQ value of each group was measured and studied to gauge the influence of bone quality and surgical procedure on implant primary stability. The three-dimensional implant fixture-bone structure was designed for finite element analysis and the dominant resonance frequency was measured with three distinctive densities of interfacial bone secluding the implant fixture. Results indicated that the ISQ values of type 1 bone were higher than those of type 2 bone in each group. In both Type 1 and Type 2 bones, the tapping group had the lowest ISQ value amongst the three insertion methods. Also, though the compaction group showed slightly higher mean ISQ values than the self-tapping groups, the difference was not statistically significant. Finally, increased interfacial bone density raised the resonance frequency value in the finite element analysis. This study concludes that both bone quality and surgical technique have an effect on the implant primary stability, and resonance frequency displays a positive correlation with the density of implant fixture-surrounding bone.", "label": "gpt3re"}

Both total covering and single partial covering models cannot effectively fit the observed absorption, and double partial covering or partial covering combined with warm absorption is required. The double partial covering model fits the data best, with large column densities of @xmath0 (320)@xmath1 @xmath2 being measured regardless of the specific spectral model employed. This value is over an order of magnitude higher than what is expected based on measurements at longer wavelengths. This suggests that the X-ray absorption is likely to occur in gas with a small amount of dust or gas located inside the broad line region.

{"text": "Exploring the nature of dark matter observationally, the next generation of CMB experiments, galaxy surveys and high-redshift observations can show potential promises. To do so, we present a phenomenological model for a generalized dark matter component and discuss its effects on large-scale structure and CMB anisotropies. With the use of symmetries, conservation laws, and gauge invariance, we develop a 3 component parameterization that presents the effects of GDM. It allows a particle component (e.g. WIMPs, radiation or massive neutrinos), a cosmological constant, and a scalar field component. In addition, its clustered properties can be specified independently of its equation of state which paves way for altering the amplitude and features in the matter power spectrums relative to those of CMB anisotropies. In turn, such observational constraints can be hugely helpful in determining the nature of dark matter.", "label": "gpt3re"}

{"text": "The simulation of biomolecular systems is faced with an important challenge of providing a quantitative description of the protonation and deprotonation of amino acid residues. Despite the fact that the process of adding or removing a positively charged hydrogen nucleus appears to be straightforward, simulating the actual protonation/deprotonation process is highly demanding. It requires taking into consideration the explicit treatment of the excess proton and its charge defect delocalization, its Grotthuss shuttling through inhomogeneous moieties (water and amino residues), and an extensive sampling of coupled condensed phase motions. Recently, a multiscale approach was introduced in a paper (J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2014, 10, 2729 - 2737) to map high-level quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) data into a multiscale reactive molecular dynamics (MS-RMD) model for elucidating the deprotonation of amino acids in bulk water. Here, we applied the fitting approach (called FITRMD) to create MS-RMD models for ionizable amino acids within proteins. The results demonstrate that the MS-RMD models generated are able to accurately reproduce the free energy profiles of the reference QM/MM Hamiltonian for proton transfer inside an example protein, the ClC-ec1 H+/Cl antiporter. Furthermore, these models are computationally efficient enough to describe more complex two-dimensional free energy surfaces due to slow degrees of freedom, such as water hydration of internal protein cavities which can be coupled to proton charge translocation. The FITRMD method is therefore a practical way to deliver ab-initio level accuracy into a much more computationally efficient reactive MD approach in order to simulate and quantitatively analyze amino acid protonation/deprotonation in proteins.", "label": "gpt3re"}

Additionally, two sources displayed components going radially at distinctly different structural position angles. Out of the six sources featuring multiple components with measurable proper motion, the innermost component was found to be significantly slower than the others, indicating acceleration in the jet.

{"text": "By studying a mass model for spiral galaxies, with the dark matter surface density being a scaled version of the observed HI surface density, we found good fits for most galaxies in a sample of 24 with reliable rotation curves. The scaling factor was approximately 7, with some cases of higher values, after accounting for primordial helium. There were some instances where this model did not fit as well, due to a rapid decline of the HI surface density in the outermost regions. As a result of imperfections in this model and possible selection effects, it is not possible to conclude that there is a correlation between HI and dark matter in spiral galaxies.", "label": "gpt3re"}
{"text": "This paper reviews the currently available evidence on the burden of the corporate tax fromHarberger-type general equilibrium models in open economies. Four major studies are examined and compared, including their assumptions of key elasticities that cause different estimates. Adjusting these estimates to reflect commonly used empirical elasticities suggests capital bears a majority of the burden. Another proposed method is introduced which considers the worldwide average corporate tax but also considers variances from this average which are assigned based on a review of general equilibrium models. This creates an alternative approach that suggests that capital could bear virtually the entire corporate tax burden, even in an open economy, despite the open-economy assumption. Drawbacks to the use of general equilibrium models, such as their focus on the long-run when reality could be extended to the short-run, are discussed.", "label": "gpt3re"}

This bonus was met with criticism from the Prison Officers Association and Steve Gillan, their general secretary, called it \"scandalous and shameful\". His payment was revealed in an annual report from NOMS which noted that bonuses are determined by a committee headed by Richard Heaton of the Ministry of Justice, and are based on an individual's \"performance levels\". It also became known that in 2015-16, even though there were no performance bonuses for Spurr, payments were made to other directors. Furthermore, the report showed that NOMS breached government pay policy when it increased overtime pay to prison officers and raised allowances for other officers, though the payments still went ahead. Lastly, the report said that all prisons in England and Wales are expected to become smoke-free by the end of 2018, a plan that mirrors Scotland's plans in which all prisons will become smoke-free by next year. Michael Spurr, formerly of the National Offender Management Service, received a payment of £15,000-20,000 on top of the annual salary of £145,000-150,000, in 2016-17. This was met with outrage from the Prison Officers Association which called it \"scandalous and shameful\", due to his overseeing a crisis in the prison service.

The film captures the moment in time when boxing shifted from the rough and violent bare-knuckle bouts to the more polished and regulated fights governed by the Marquis of Queensbury rules. It's not an accurate portrayal of the history, but instead romanticized and comical. Errol Flynn plays a charming yet cocky James J.

To round the movie off, John L Sullivan (whose popular quote wasn't \"I can lick any man in the world\", of course) gifts Corbett his belt, a scene among the best from any sports movie ever.

Soon though, this is gone and it descends into a chaotic and unfocused piece that fails to identify its protagonist or decide whether it is meant to be an outlandishly eccentric Araki movie, a documentary with snippets of dialogue scattered throughout, or something else. It has no climax or resolution, and the vast amount of prolonged skateboarding scenes in this film mean that at least 20 minutes can be cut out by fast-forwarding them. It is meant to demonstrate the disparities between the haves and the have-nots, though this is made evident very early on, and fails to compare favourably to films like 'Kids' and 'Bully', as this movie felt highly rehearsed, shoddily executed, and with wooden acting.

The effects of each stimulation method were measured by evaluating motor-evoked-potential amplitudes in the time sequence after stimulation compared to sham stimulation. The analysis demonstrated a significant enhancement of M1 excitability caused by all three active stimulations, though there was no notable difference between them.

{"text": "This research aims to assess the relevance of varying gut microbiota composition and stool consistency by using the Bristol Stool Scale. 16s rRNA Illumina profiling of faecal samples from 53 healthy women was used to evaluate the association between microbiome richness, Bacteroides:Firmicutes ratio, enterotypes and genus abundance with stool consistency. Results showed strong correlations between stool consistency, species richness, Bacteroides:Firmicutes ratio, and Akkermansia and Methanobrevibacter abundance. Moreover, enterotypes were found to be distinctly distributed over the BSS scores. With respect to the correlations betwee microbiota growth potential and stool consistency scores, it appears that accelerated transit contributes to colon ecosystem differentiation in Ruminococcaceae-Bacteroides samples, whilst adhering to host tissue is a more likely bacterial strategy in the Prevotella group to counter washing out.

Although it has been observed that global mean surface air temperature has increased by 0.3 to 0.6 °C over the last 100 years which is consistent with climate models calculations and natural climate variability, an unequivocal confirmation of the greenhouse effect may not be attainable in the next decade or two.", "label": "gpt3re"}
{"text": "SHALLOW GRAVE kicks off with a scene that could be seen as either a tribute to or a rip-off of the famous shower scene in PSYCHO. The film starts out dishearteningly and eventually improves, approaching an almost original level in its story. Unfortunately, the acting is poor and the directing is amateur, yet it still manages to be better than many other entries in the \"Yankee goes South and gets killed by a bunch of rednecks\" genre due to the fact it was shot in the South.The story follows four college girls heading to Ft. Lauderdale for their summer vacation, but they veer off the main highway and end up getting a flat tire in Georgia. Sue Ellen (Lisa Stahl) decides to step into the nearby woods to use the restroom. When she finds a place to do her business, she unknowingly witnesses the local sheriff (Tony March) strangling his mistress (Merry Rozelle) to death. (Another reminder for any Yankees travelling to the South: don't wander off into the woods!) This is where the story itself begins to become interesting.Though he certainly won't win any awards for it, Tony March's portrayal of Sheriff Dean becomes a compelling and rather disturbing eerie example of a man struggling with his actions. Tom Law is likewise quite convincing as Deputy Scott, and is the most authentically Southern deputy on screen since Walton Goggins' portrayal of Deputy Steve Naish in HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSES.There are several standout scenes in the movie. The girls pause at a BBQ in South Carolina where they unknowingly display their racism towards a burly black guy who stares at them. Sue Ellen then flees into a barn and finds herself hiding behind bales of hay, only to discover a large snake is lurking there alongside her. In the strangest and most disturbing scene in the movie, Sheriff Dean orders Patty (Carol Cadby) to take off her clothes while implying he's about to rape her. The radio is turned up to muffle their conversation, and the sermon that is playing is about Jezebel being saved by the blood of Jesus Christ - a strange and rather inappropriate choice of sermon for the moment given that Jezebel was a part of the Old Testament and Jesus Christ was not even born when she was around.", "label": "gpt3re"}

{"text": "We conducted numerical experiments to investigate how the asphericities induced by the growth of the Standing Accretion Shock Instability (SASI) affects the gravitational waveforms in the post-bounce phase of core-collapse supernovae. We parameterized neutrino fluxes from the central protoneutron star and utilized a light-bulb approach to approximate neutrino transfer. We observed that waveforms as a result of anisotropic neutrino emissions increase monotonically in amplitude, up to two orders of magnitude greater than waveforms caused by convective matter motions outside of the protoneutron star. Amplitudes began to become larger when the nonlinear stage of SASI growth began and caused deformations of shocks and greater anisotropic emission of neutrinos. After analyzing the waveform's spectrum, we determined that the amplitudes from neutrinos dominated those from matter motions beneath @xmath0 Hz, which are thought to be detectable by next-generation detectors such as LCGT and Advanced LIGO for a supernova 10 kpc away. As a source of gravitational wave background, we concluded that amplitudes of this source surpassed the primordial gravitational wave background at frequencies above @xmath1 1 Hz, though this is invisible for space-based detectors.", "label": "gpt3re"}

{"text": "We study the flux and angular power spectrum of gamma-rays produced by dark matter annihilations in the Milky Way (MW) and from extra-galactic halos. The annihilation signal encompasses contributions from (a) the smooth MW halo, (b) resolved and unresolved MW substructures, (c) external DM halos at all redshifts, and (d) their substructures. Using a consistent description of local and extra-galactic substructures, we show that the annihilation flux from MW substructures dominates for angles of more than 1 degree from the galactic center unless an extreme prescription for substructures concentration is adopted. Additionally, we calculate the gamma-ray anisotropy angular power spectrum and find that, for an optimistic set of particle physics parameters, a distinctive signature of DM annihilation could be identified by the Fermi LAT satellite at low multipoles (l < 1), where the major contribution comes from MW substructures with mass (M < 2).

{"text": "The study led by the National Center for Atmospheric Research (the federal research arm of the National Science Foundation) revealed a growing concern - by the 2030s, a warming planet may lead to noticeable declines in oxygen levels in many of the world's oceans, resulting in difficulties for marine life to survive. This may be due to the drop of oxygen levels caused by climate change, which could surpass natural variability - such as the el Nino cycle - in just 10 to 15 years. These findings show how climate change can affect oceans' oxygen concentrations and threaten marine life. Matthew Long, the lead author of the study, commented: \"Loss of oxygen in the oceans is one of the serious side effects of a warming atmosphere, and a major threat to marine life. Since oxygen concentrations in the ocean naturally vary depending on variations in winds and temperature at the surface, it's been challenging to attribute any de-oxygenation to climate change.

{"text": "Crossfire is an unusual suspense thriller directed by Edward Dmytryk that utilizes the themes and techniques of the noir cycle. Set in Washington DC, a group of soldiers pass their free time at bars until three of them arrive at a stranger's apartment. Robert Ryan, in a drunken state, beats the host - a Jewish man - to death. Detective Robert Young, assisted by Robert Mitchum, who is assigned to Ryan's unit, investigates the friend's disappearance. Suspicion falls onto the second of the group, George Cooper, who has gone missing. To keep the third silent, Ryan kills him before Young can get to him.This powerful film was created with the assistance of an excellent script by John Paxton that features superb performances from the three main stars: Robert Ryan doing his identifiable Angry White Male role, Robert Mitchum portraying his characteristic calmness, and Robert Young at his best. Gloria Grahame gives her first notable performance of a smart-mouthed, vulnerable women, and Paul Kelly appears in a small and gripping part.Most notably, Edward Dmytryk has a political agenda in the film, briefly addressing the antisemitism of the time by having Robert Young reminisce about the bigotry faced by his Irish grandfather a century earlier. However, for the most part, there is no focus on explaining why Robert Ryan is so prejudiced.The original version of the screenplay was focused on a homophobic hate crime, but had to be adjusted to antisemitism due to homosexuality remaining a taboo topic in 1947. This shift works fairly well overall, although the circumstances in which the Jewish host is murdered are somewhat unclear - leaving some to wonder whether the scene was left intentionally to allude to the true motive behind the murder.", "label": "gpt3re"}

Some people may think that if they have enough money, they can do whatever they want. But if they think more about the future instead of themselves, they would do something more beneficial. This movie isn't just about kids; it conveys that children are often more mindful of nature than adults. When I was twelve, I saw some waterlilies, and even though I knew that they were protected by law, I didn't want to risk harming them. The acting in this movie was exemplary; the three main characters were portrayed very well and we should take a lesson from them. I hope you will keep in mind what you've learned from watching it, and enjoy!", "label": "gpt3re"}

What is the most optimal softening length to best replicate Newtonian dynamics given a specific form of softened gravity? Here we showcase a method that is beneficial not only for testing, but also in the development of new concepts regarding softening. This method compares the dynamic effects between the various types of softened gravity, including anisotropic alternatives, while striving to discover the optimal form of softened gravity for desired dynamical accuracy, ultimately leading to a more physically sound modeling.", "label": "gpt3re"}

Generally, the innate response is activated when certain conserved components of microorganisms are identified by pattern recognition receptors, or when damaged, distressed or injured cells release alarm signals, which some of these receptors detect. Innate immune defense is not specific to any one pathogen but is instead seen as a generic response. The consequences of this type of response are not long-lasting and this is typically the most prominent form of defense for most organisms.", "label": "gpt3re"}

Molecules with the lighter isotope, oxygen-16, evaporate more easily than those with the heavier oxygen-18, and the disparity increases at lower temperatures. Consequently, when global temperatures decline, the snow and rain formed out of the evaporated water has higher levels of oxygen-16, and the seawater left behind is higher in oxygen-18. This results in the organisms incorporating more oxygen-18 into their shells and skeletons compared to a warmer climate.

However, 10 of the UC patients had irregular PPS domes with sparse, atrophic villi surrounding them, although there were only minimal mucosal lesions present. A combination of electron microscopy and magnifying endoscopy before and after remission with prednisolone-mesalazine therapy confirmed that these lesions were reversible.

Despite this, not many PPC marketers are aware of the different sources of keyword and search term data that they can use. This article will discuss three useful sources that marketers may not be familiar with. 1. Google AdWords: search term reports You are probably aware that Google AdWords is a key source of keyword data, however, what most people don't know is that targeting a specific keyword does not necessarily mean targeting a specific search. Depending on the match type selected, keywords can match to different related terms. Here is how to locate the search terms related to a keyword: Go to the keyword you want to viewSelect the keyword via the selection box left of its status iconSelect the 'Details' dropdown and then the search terms sectionChoose the 'Selected' optionSearch term reports can be used to generate new negative keywords (preventing irrelevant and poor performing traffic from appearing in your ad group or campaign) as well as to find new keywords for your account (allowing you to create individual bids for each keyword). 2. Google AdWords Shopping search term reports Even though Shopping campaigns don't need keyword targeting, you can still view which search terms match with your products or product groups. This is especially important as it prevents poor quality or irrelevant traffic from appearing. To obtain this data: Navigate to the product group in your Shopping campaign to view Go to the Keywords tabSelect the 'Details' dropdownUnder the 'Search Terms' section, choose the 'All' option to view all the search terms that have matched your product groupThe main use of the data obtained from this is to identify negative keywords and stop poor performing traffic from appearing.

The Devon Wildlife Trust (DWT) stated that the growth of the beaver population is allowing the organization to gain insight into their effects on the nearby River Otter, although the Angling Trust warned that an excessive population increase carries the potential of inflicting harm on other wildlife. The two female beavers, who were found to be pregnant when taken into captivity, are thought to be the first extinct species to be reintroduced to England in recent years, whereas wild boar have naturalised after escaping from cagey conditions. Beavers were hunted for their valuable fur and glandular oil during the 12th century, leading to their extinction in the UK by the 1600s. Mark Elliott from the DWT declared how delighted they are with the news of the breeding, while Steve Hussey also from DWT commented on the beavers' population rate and said that they have no plans to tag the beavers unless for identification, emphasising the importance of causing minimal disruption. Highlighting the great influence beavers have on their environment, Tom Buckley commented on how overwhelmed he felt when observing the new kits.

{"text": "Recently, the Planck Collaboration published precise and resolved measurements of the Sunyaev-Zel’dovich effect in Abell 1656 (the Coma cluster of galaxies) to directly measure the electron pressure profile of the intracluster plasma. This measurement was compared to the pressure obtained by combining the density and temperature provided by X-ray observations of the thermal bremsstrahlung radiation emitted by the plasma. It was found that there is a model-independent tension between the SZ and the X-ray pressure, with the SZ one being significantly lower by 0. We suggest that this challenging tension can be resolved by introducing an additional, non-thermal support to the gravitational equilibrium of the intracluster plasma. This can be incorporated into the 'supermodel' to fit the Planck SZ profile while remaining consistent with the X-ray observables. Possible origins of this nonthermal component include cosmic ray protons, ongoing turbulence, and relativistic electrons. Of these, we specifically focus on relativistic electrons as acceleration of electrons to energies of 1 is necessary for the Coma radiohalo. For this to be effective, many more lower-energy electrons must be present, starting with merging events providing the intracluster plasma’s high central entropy in Coma.", "label": "gpt3re"}

After assessing the cases of 500 people who accessed their pension funds, Citizens Advice discovered that 9% experienced unexpected taxation issues, while 6% experienced reductions in welfare payments. What's more, twice as many individuals used the funds to cover their everyday lives rather than paying off debts. Gillian Guy, the CEO of Citizens Advice, commented: “The pension freedoms are popular with customers, but some are experiencing losses. These changes are giving many people choices on how to access their retirement savings, and how to use the money to best fit their lifestyle.\" Furthermore, Steve Webb, the former pensions minister and now the director of policy for Royal London pensions, argued: “If individuals are just putting their money into a bank account as a stopgap before reinvesting, then there is little to worry about. However, if they leave the funds in an account generating little or no interest, the value of the real money is likely to drop year after year due to inflation.” The Association of British Insurers also highlighted that a minority of those aged 55 and over have taken out large sums from their pension pots. To ensure that individuals are aware of all their options, they underlined the importance of receiving Pension Wise guidance.", "label": "gpt3re"}

{"text": "IntroductionSitus Inversus Totalis (SIT) is a rare and congenital condition that is characterized by a complete transposition of the thoracic and abdominal organs. Here, we present two successful cases of left thoracoscopic esophagectomy via the prone position in patients suffering from SIT-associated esophageal cancer. Presentation of CasesOur first case involved an 82-year-old man who underwent a left thoracoscopic esophagectomy in the prone position, followed by a hand-assisted laparoscopic gastric mobilization. The surgical duration and blood loss were 661 minutes and 165g respectively. His postoperative course was uneventful. The second case was of a 66-year-old man who underwent a left thoracoscopic esophagectomy in the prone position, followed by a gastric mobilization via laparotomy as there was a concomitant intestinal malrotation and polysplenia. The surgical duration and blood loss were 637 minutes and 220g respectively. We preoperatively trained for the surgical procedure by using left-inverted and right-inverted thoracoscopic surgical videos of patients with normal anatomy.DiscussionThe surgical procedures in SIT patients can be challenging due the mirrored anatomy, thus recognizing the variations is essential to avoid accidental intraoperative injuries. Left-inverted and right-inverted thoracoscopic surgical videos of patients with normal anatomy were found to be very helpful for image training in preparation for the actual surgery.ConclusionThoracoscopic surgical treatment for esophageal cancer associated with SIT in the prone position can be performed safely, similarly to the manner in which it is performed for thoracoscopic surgeries in the right decubitus position or even surgery via an open thoracotomy. Gastric mobilization via laparotomy should be considered for patients who are associated with other anatomic variations.", "label": "gpt3re"}

Both detached (det-hDOC) and adherent (adh-hDOC) hDOC cells can be utilized and, in a simulation of the two forms of administration in vitro, it has been seen that det-hDOCs can cause a low decrease of CD80 and CD86 on DCs, bringing about a gentle modulation of DC functionality that does not completely halt the high capability of DCs to start T-cell growth and produce CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ T cells. Furthermore, det-hDOCs can amplify the DC ability to differentiate CD4+CD161+CD196+ TH17-cells by increasing IL-6 secretion. On the flip side, adh-hDOC highly reduce DC functions with a heavy decrease of CD80 and CD86 on DCs, accumulating to conclusion of TGF- creation.

{"text": "In this paper, a comprehensive investigation of classical and quantum geometrically frustrated Ising models with a competing ordering mechanism is presented. The ordering is realized through coupling 2D layers in the classical case, and through quantum dynamics induced by a transverse field in the quantum case. Through mapping the Ising models on a triangular lattice to elastic lattices of non-crossing strings, an exact relation between spin variables and the displacement field of the strings is derived. Using this mapping for both the classical (2+1)D stacked model and the quantum frustrated 2D system, a microscopic formulation of an effective Hamiltonian, proposed in a Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson approach beforehand, is furnished. This derivation comes with the coupling constants, allowing the entire transverse field-temperature phase diagram to be determined, including the universality classes of both the quantum and the finite temperature transitions. The structure of the ordered phase is deduced from an entropic argument. Comparing with recent simulations of the quantum system, a good agreement is obtained. The connection between the model and a dimer model on the hexagonal lattice, and its height profile representation, is also explored, leading to a straightforward derivation of the continuum free energy, as well as a physical explanation of the universality of the stiffness of the height profile for anisotropic couplings.", "label": "gpt3re"}

{"text": "The effects of charge fluctuations of two closely located mesoscopic conductors that are coupled solely through the long-range Coulomb force are explored and used to determine the dephasing rate of one conductor on the other. This exploration is based on a formulation of the scattering approach for charge densities and the response of the density to a fluctuating potential. Connecting to the Poisson equation yields a self-consistent description of the charge fluctuations. Under equilibrium, the low-frequency sound power can be expressed with the help of a charge relaxation resistor (which, together with the capacitance, determines the RC time of the structure). When transport is present, the low-frequency charge sound power is determined by a resistor that reflects the existence of shot sound. By applying these findings, expressions for dephasing rates of Coulomb connected conductors are derived, and a self-consistent expression for the measurement time is achieved.", "label": "gpt3re"}
{"text": "We present a method to reduce the time it takes for a stochastic sampling of a complex energy landscape in a statistical system with discrete degrees of freedom to reach equilibrium. This method is an extension of a platform developed for continuous systems and starts with a master equation, instead of the Fokker-Planck equation used in the continuous case. This master equation is transformed into an imaginary-time Schrödinger equation and the Hamiltonian is adjusted by adding a projector to the known ground state. We demonstrate how this transformation helps to reduce relaxation time, as well as suggest a way to speed up simulated annealing for optimization problems. We have implemented our method in a simplified kinetic Monte Carlo scheme, leading to an increase in speed of simulated annealing for the symmetric traveling salesman problem by an order of magnitude. We have also compared our simulated annealing to the exchange Monte Carlo algorithm for the three-dimensional Ising spin glass. This implementation can be seen as a step forward in accelerating the stochastic sampling of generic systems with intricate landscapes that take a long time to achieve equilibrium.", "label": "gpt3re"}

Out of 8983 ACS patients enrolled in the Israeli Survey from 2000-2010, those with severe Left Ventricle Dysfunction (LVD) (LVEF < 30%, n = 845), mild-moderate LVD (LVEF 30-49%, n = 4470) and preserved LVD (LVEF ≥ 50%, n = 3659) were categorized. Using a Cox Proportional Hazards Regression Model, we determined risk factors for 1-year mortality according to LVEF. Over the past decade, there was a decrease in the proportion of patients admitted with lower LVEF and the mortality rate was highest (36%) in the severe LVD group, and intermediate (10%) and lowest (4%) in the mild-moderate and preserved LVD groups respectively (p < 0.001). Clinical features such as syncope, anterior myocardial infarction, and STEMI (ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction) at first admission were linked to mortality in the severe LVD group. In the more preserved LVD group, the presence of medical conditions such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, and peripheral arterial disease, were linked to mortality. Age and Killip Class II at admission were consistent predictive factors for all LVEF subsets. In conclusion, LVEF at first admission is a strong predictor of mortality in ACS patients, with prognostic factors varying according to LVEF. In patients with severe LVD, signs of clinical instability were related to 1-year mortality, while in those with more preserved LVD, the prognosis was connected with the presence of comorbidities.", "label": "gpt3re"}
{"text": "Lateral (i.e. side-to-side) pressure or loads can cause metal to deform or even break easily, particularly when it comes to soft steels, such as those with a Rockwell hardness of 58HRC or lower. This can be seen in the attached photos of the Global G-61 Chefs knife and Henckel Chef's knife, which feature large sections of missing metal on the G-61 – likely due to metal fatigue. The outcome of this force being applied – whether it be chipping or bending – depends on the properties of the steel and Rockwell hardness, as well as the force that is being applied. For example, the Aritsugu A-type Gyuto shows wear and dulling that is usually seen with harder steel knives, looking like a small saw. Despite having a relatively soft steel of 60-61HRC, it still fractures on a microscopic level and does not bend a lot. However, even harder knives of 63-65HRC may bend with normal use due to a rolling of the edge. As such, the outcome of excessive force being applied largely depends on the properties of the steel, its hardness and the cutting medium, among other factors. An example of what excessive force on a harder blade can do is shown in a photo of a damaged Shun paring knife edge, with multiple chips and cracks visible in the tip section.

Our solution avoids cryptographic approaches, which may introduce significant computational complexity, by making use of third-party computation without making unrealistic assumptions about their trustworthiness. In the proposed scheme, individual participants secure the data prior to sharing it with the third party by using a secure hashing scheme with shared keys. We prove theoretically that the hashing scheme prevents the third party from recovering any information about the individual signals or their statistics from individual computations or long-term aggregate patterns.

Starting with around one electron per channel, no detectable transfer errors occurred while clocking @xmath0 pixels. To measure the uniformity of electron occupancy in the 120 parallel channels, one channel, with its associated gates, was set perpendicular to the others - this enabled not only for efficient electron transport but also for measurement.", "label": "gpt3re"}

{"text": "An 82-year-old woman with moderate ocular pain in her left eye for one week was reported with a case of tectonic corneal transplantation for impending perforation to preserve its anatomical integrity. Abnormal tissues around the perforation area were carefully removed with a crescent blade and Vannas scissors before the patient received a tectonic deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty, using a cryopreserved cornea stored in Optisol GS solution at -70 for four weeks. After six months of surgery, the cornea remained transparent, was restored to its normal thickness, and did not display any complications such as corneal haze or scars, graft rejection, recurrent corneal ulcer, and postoperative rise of intraocular pressure. It is concluded that cryopreserved donor lamellar tissue is an effective substitute in emergency tectonic lamellar keratoplasty, especially in cases of impending corneal perforation and severe necrotic keratitis.", "label": "gpt3re"}

In 911, King Charles III of West Francia established the Duchy of Normandy by signing the Treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte with legendary Viking ruler, Rollo. The treaty gave Rollo and his men control over the French lands between the Epte and the Atlantic coast in exchange for them guarding against more Viking incursions. This land corresponded to the northern part of present-day Upper Normandy and stretched to the Seine, though the Duchy ultimately expanded west of the Seine.

On Thursday, Yahoo general counsel Ron Bell disputed these reports as \"misleading\" and argued the government should formally explain and clarify their position to the public. Bell called for the government to confirm the surveillance order, to declassify it, and to make a \"sufficiently detailed public and contextual comment,\" in a letter published on Yahoo's Tumblr blog. He further argued that the mail scanning asserted in the news did not exist on their systems. In response to these allegations, Yahoo reaffirmed its commitment to complying with U.S. laws, and to protecting their users' rights through transparency.

{"text": "Empire of Passion may surprise viewers, as it doesn't immediately appear to be a horror movie. At the beginning of the film, it seems as if it is a riff on James M. Cain's The Postman Always Rings Twice: Seki (Kazuko Yoshiyuki) is a mother of two and a dutiful wife to her husband, rickshaw driver Gisaburo (Takahiro Tamura). Meanwhile, the impulsive and directionless young man Toyoji (Tatsuya Fuji) visits Seki when Gisaburo is not around, and they eventually start a sexual relationship. This eventually leads to them attempting to kill Gisaburo, an act that comes back to haunt them. The horror in this film comes from the suspense building up as the characters are dealing with the consequences of their actions, rather than any explicitly supernatural elements. Although the movie starts to become melodramatic at the end, director Oshima crafts shot after shot with beautiful visuals, such as the dutch angles and slow motion scenes. Empire of Passion is ultimately an exploration of the connections between life and death and the fate of the souls of Seki and Toyoji.", "label": "gpt3re"}

Twelve patients underwent a RE acute session with 60% and another with 90% of the one repetition maximum test. Heart rate variability indexes were obtained in the time and frequency domains to measure autonomic modulation. Results showed that regardless of exercise intensity, RE acute sessions impacted autonomic modulation, with an increase in standard deviation of normal to normal R-R intervals through the recovery period compared to baseline. Low frequency index and high frequency index also increased throughout recovery when compared to baseline in both protocols. Concluding that RE sessions affect autonomic modulation of COPD patients by promoting differences in recovery period compared to baseline, regardless of the intensity of the exercise performed.", "label": "gpt3re"}

{"text": "In case a Directive's implementation is not completed on time, the Member State is not allowed to pass conflicting laws and citizens can refer to the Directive (known as \"vertical\" direct effect). In Pubblico Ministero v Ratti, due to the delayed implementation of Directive 73/173/EEC on packaging and labelling solvents, the Italian government was not permitted to act against Mr Ratti's solvent and varnish business. This means that a member state cannot \"rely, as against individuals, on its own failure to fulfill the obligations imposed by the Directive.” Moreover, a person or a company have the right to cite a Directive in disputes with fellow individuals or companies. This was mentioned in CIA Security v Signalson and Securitel, where the Court of Justice claimed a business called CIA Security could guard itself from accusations by rivals that it did not meet a Belgian decree from 1991 about alarms systems, considering that it was not reported to the Commission as a Directive requested. Another situation that a Directive may be invoked between private non-state parties prior to its deadline for implementation is when it is associated with a \"general principle\" of EU law. This was settled in Kücükdeveci v Swedex GmbH & Co KG, which had German Civil Code §622 dictating that years worked under 25 will not count towards the increasing required notice before dismissal. Ms Kücükdeveci contended that this law was unlawful age discrimination under the Employment Equality Framework Directive. Subsequently, the Court of Justice decreed that the Directive could be invoked by her because equality was a fundamental principle of EU law. Furthermore, even if the defendant is not the central government, it can be compellable to Directives when it is treated as an emanation of the state. In Foster v British Gas plc, the Court of Justice determined that Mrs Foster was allotted to the legal action of gender discrimination against British Gas plc, which made females retire at age 60 and males at 65, provided that they adequately held (1) a state measure, (2) offered a public service, and (3) had exclusive rights.

This follows a rising trend of posting health inspection grades on restaurants, which is already observed in cities like Los Angeles County and New York City. The UK has even adopted a similar system nationally. King County officials believe that the emoji system is the first in America. The aim of the emoji system is to make the food risk information more easily accessible to people from a range of backgrounds, especially those who don't speak English. The rating system differs from others in thatrepeated inspections can't be carried out for a single restaurant, and restaurants are scored on a 'curve' system that takes into account their individual environment and inspector.

Despite increasingly larger budgets and cutting-edge special effects, the subsequent blockbusters have all been disappointingly generic. This likely has caused investors, and audiences, to become wary of future offerings. The latest example is a dragon-centric movie which stumbles at even making use of the special effects it is given.

From the fields of a Republican stronghold in Florida to the small town diners of North Carolina, the suburbs of Arkansas and the streets of working-class Staten Island in New York City, voters who elected him were willing to give him a pass and stress his short time in office. Many suggested that as a businessman, Trump will not take 'no' for an answer and will ultimately get the job done. However, some supporters blamed the President partially for the failure of the effort to repeal and replace the 2010 Affordable Care Act.

This is believed to be due to either the risk of contracting ‘foot-in-mouth-disease’ or age, with many chief executives in the 50-to-60 age range. Even extroverted CEO Sir Richard Branson, who has 6 million followers, has made the occasional gaffe due to Twitter - such as when he tweeted \"Space is hard - but worth it,\" following the fatal Virgin Galactic crash. According to Talkwalker CEO Robert Glaesener, leaving Twitter campaigns in the hands of the corporate PR teams sometimes does not end up any better either. Leaving the case of Indiana's new law aside, which Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, used his Twitter power to combat, companies that have invested in Social Media are finding benefits from it. They are coming across as more human to their customers, while also providing \"unfiltered\" feedback and two-way communication.

{"text": "Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) Disease and Sympathetic Ophthalmia (SO) are types of T-cell mediated autoimmune granulomatous uveitis. Clinical features of both of these diseases are similar, yet they vary in gender prevalence. VKH is reported to be more commonly seen in females in comparison to males, although some studies in Japan and China reported no difference in gender prevalence. Patients who are male tend to have a higher risk of chorioretinal degeneration, vitiligo, and worse prognosis. On the other hand, estrogen and progesterone levels in females during pregnancy, menstrual cycle, and higher levels of TGF-β offer a protective role for females. HLA-DR and HLA-DQ alleles could be associated with the female predilection seen in VKH. SO, a bilateral granulomatous uveitis, is caused by an eye injury from trauma or surgery. So, is more known to affect males, due to a higher number of ocular injuries typically seen in wartime tensions. However, no gender predilection has been reported in postsurgical cases of SO. There are no differing clinical manifestations between males and females in SO secondary to ocular trauma or surgery.

{"text": "Given an integer, the integer factorization problem is the task of determining what prime numbers combine to make up the integer. Put another way, it is deciding whether the input has a factor less than k. To date, no efficient algorithm for this task has been found, making it the foundation for various cryptographic systems such as RSA. It is believed to be in NP and co-NP, and even in UP and co-UP. If it is found to be NP-complete, the polynomial time hierarchy would contract to one level (meaning NP would equal co-NP). The most efficient current algorithm for integer factorization is the general number field sieve, which takes O(e(64/9)1/3(n.log 2)1/3(log (n.log 2))2/3) time to determine the prime factors of an n-bit integer.

{"text": "We present the algorithm and validation for Omega, a systematic, knowledge-based conformer generator. The algorithm consists of three phases: assembling an initial 3D structure from a library of fragments, enumerating all rotatable torsions using values from a knowledge-based list of angles to generate a set of conformations, and sampling this set through geometric and energy criteria. To validate conformer generators like Omega, comparison to experimental molecular conformations from crystallography, usually from the Protein Data Bank (PDB), is often attempted. However, such an approach is hindered due to systematic issues with small molecule structures in the PDB. Methods have been developed to identify a diverse set of small molecule structures from cocomplexes in the PDB that are highly reliable. A set of 197 high quality, precisely selected ligand structures from well-solved models was obtained using these methods. This set will be an ideal basis for comparison and validation of conformer generators in the future. Validation results from this set are compared to those using structures of a set of druglike molecules extracted from the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD). The results demonstrate that Omega is proficient at reproducing the crystallographic conformations from both data sets using two distinct metrics of success.", "label": "gpt3re"}

{"text": "A generalized Davydov model is used to describe the two-vibron dynamics associated with the amide-I vibrations in a 3D @xmath0-helix. This helix is composed of three spines of hydrogen-bonded peptide units connected by covalent bonds. It is revealed that the two-vibron energy spectrum contains both two-vibron free states and two kinds of bound states (TVBS-I and TVBS-II), which are associated with the trapping of two vibrons onto the same amide-I mode and onto two nearest neighbor amide-I modes residing in the same spine, respectively. At low temperature, nonzero interspine hopping constants enable both TVBS-I and TVBS-II to become three-dimensional in nature, with wavefunctions that extend across the three spines of the helix. At biological temperatures, the pairs are then confined to a single spine, exhibiting features similar to the bound states in a one-dimensional model. This interplay of temperature and three-dimensional nature of the helix is also responsible for the emergence of a third bound state (TVBS-III) which denotes the trapping of two vibrons onto two different spines. The experimentally observed signature of the bound states is then discussed through simulating the infrared pump-probe spectroscopic response, and the possibility of breather-like behavior of two-vibron bound states is also addressed.", "label": "gpt3re"}

We checked the expression of genes related to bile acid synthesis and transport, as well as the level of 7-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-1 in the plasma. ER stress was found to reduce the hepatic expression of the primary enzyme involved in bile acid synthesis (cholesterol 7-hydroxylase). Additionally, plasma levels of 7-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-1 were lowered, pointing to reduced bile acid creation. Expression of the bile salt export pump (ATP-binding cassette [ABC]B11) and a bile salt efflux pump (ABCC3) were raised. These changes seemed unrelated to hepatic inflammation and to the activation of hepatic small heterodimer partner and intestine fibroblast growth factor 15.

Results showed no statistically significant difference between Piolreal and Pioladj when ELP was used, with a range of agreement between calculations of 1.23 diopters. When not using ELP, Piolreal was significantly higher than both Pioladj and the estimates from other formulas. Results concluded that predictable refractive outcomes can be obtained with Crystalens HD using a variable keratometric index for corneal power estimation and by estimating ELP with an algorithm dependent on anatomical factors and age.", "label": "gpt3re"}
{"text": "This study aimed to determine how women perceived the quality gap in primary health care centers in Isfahan, Iran. A cross-sectional study was conducted on 1280 women who visited the health care centers. The service quality was assessed using 5 dimensions, which included tangible, confidence, responsiveness, assurance, and sympathy. The results revealed that women had varied opinions about all 5 dimensions and that the highest mean quality gap was seen in the tangible dimension (-14.41), whereas the lowest mean quality gap was seen in the assurance dimension (-11.08). The difference between the women's views in all 5 dimensions was statistically significant (p < 0.05). This suggests that the expectations of clients are higher than their understanding of the current services, leaving room for improvement in order to satisfy clients and improve services.", "label": "gpt3re"}

{"text": "Once again director Uwe Boll attempts to bring his film-making abilities to life in a scifi horror story about mercenaries and reporters facing off against super soldiers on a far-off island. Although lead actor Udo Keir does an incredibly good job, the disappointing script does not live up to its potential. The stale plot about a mad scientist being investigated by a reporter has been done time and time again, yet the script is still oddly enjoyable. The effects of the super soldiers, in particular their creepy dead eyes, are quite chilling. Sadly, Boll is seemingly not interested in the project, as he fails to capture any special spark or life in the filming process - only filming one or two takes and using whatever he has. This clearly shows that Boll is not in a period of creativity, as many of his skills have been forgotten. Seed, another one of his films, was even worse than this - making it a \"so bad its good\" movie. Therefore, it may be worth a watch if it's late at night and it's on cable - thanks to Keir's performance - but otherwise, it's best to pass.", "label": "gpt3re"}

Now, feminists view this movie as a form of female empowerment in a male-dominated world, but based on hindsight, it is unlikely either director Tourneur or Miss Peters had this intention when making the movie. It was just a fun, thrilling film, without lofty ambitions. Louis Jourdan is charming and villainous as Jean's romantic interest, Herbert Chapman is used for his wise doctor character, and James Robertson Justice doesn't become too convincing as the boson.

Initially, Col Lee resigned in protest of the original trial which did not present the full story of the circumstances that Soldier Blackman was under. He believes that the court martial should have taken into account the soldier's mental stress level at the time of the killing. The Criminal Cases Review Commission's 11-month investigation will consider new evidence regarding Blackman's mental state at the time of the shooting. The court also has to consider if the alternative verdict of 'unlawful act manslaughter' was available. Col Lee clarified that he is not seeking to condone or exonerate Blackman but rather ensure justice is served in a fair manner. David James Smith, Lead CCRC Commissioner on the case, said that Blackman has a real possibility of success on his second appeal. The crime took place during a heated battle in Helmand province after the patrol base was attacked by insurgents. When an Apache helicopter was sent for air aid, one of the attackers was injured and two marines later found the Taliban in a field.

{"text": "The NOAA Active Region 2192, observed in October 2014, was remarkable for its production of major two-ribbon flares without coronal mass ejections. Generally, a strong north-south magnetic system of arcade fields constrained a sequence of large two-ribbon flares from the core of the active region. The lack of growth in ribbon separation, coupled with the large initial separation, suggests a confined reconnection site in the corona. Using meticulous analysis of the confined X1.6 flare on October 22, we demonstrate how special the flaring of this active region was. We determine that repeat energy discharge happened, indicating that the same magnetic field structures were succesively involved in magnetic reconnection. We observe that a significant amount of electrons were accelerated to non-thermal energies with a steep power law spectrum, however not all achieved high energies. The estimated total non-thermal energy in electrons, roughly @Xmath0 j, is greater than the energy of eruptive X1 flares and accounts for about 10% of the extra magnetic energy present in the active region's corona.", "label": "gpt3re"}

In this movie, director and co-scriptwriter Dani Levy does not emulate the mechanics, assuming certain traits (such as two orderlies being gay kissing) to be humorous alone. The main characters lack a purpose for their behavior, making them bland, and the awkward incestuous relationships between them only serve as a desperate effort to make the script better. Though the actors were not bad, particularly Udo Semel's performance, and the direction is not necessarily bad either, Levy may be better off sticking to directing rather than writing screenplays. The comedy about Hitler he worked on is yet to be seen.", "label": "gpt3re"}

In this study, parallel trypsin and glu-c digestion followed by LC-MS/MS was used to gain sequence coverage of the common SP-A variants and isoform-determining peptides. Additionally, a SDS-PAGE-based multiple reaction monitoring (GelC-MRM) assay was created for the enrichment and targeted quantitation of total SP-A, the SP-A2 isoform, and the Gln223 and Lys223 variants of SP-A from as little as one milliliter of Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. This assay identified individuals with the three genotypes at the 223 position of SP-A2: homozygous major (Gln223/Gln223), homozygous minor (Lys223/Lys223) and heterozygous (Gln223/Lys223). Moreover, our research suggests the difficulty in distinguishing highly homologous, copurifying protein isoforms with MS, as well as the applicability of MRM mass spectrometry for the identification and quantitation of nonsynonymous single nucleotide variants and other proteoforms in airway lining fluid.", "label": "gpt3re"}
{"text": "This study investigated the optimal placement and screw length of C2 pedicle screw fixation by comparing it to recommendations in literature. Nine patients who underwent C2 pedicle instrumentation for either a hangman's fracture as part of C2 pedicle-C3 lateral mass fixation or for C2-C3 subluxation were included. All patients showed good postoperative improvement and satisfactory fracture consolidation. Due to the frequent observation of bony anatomical variations and fracture lines brought about by trauma, it has been concluded that a shift from the classic 20 degrees of angulation in both planes should take place. This emphasises the importance of accurate preoperative planning with the help of 3D computed tomography, as this will give the surgeon a better prediction of the best angled and safest screw length to use in the procedure.", "label": "gpt3re"}

{"text": "We look at the effects of intense electron-electron interactions on the surface of cubic topological kondo insulators (e.g. samarium hexaboride, SMB@XMath0). These materials typically have three copies of massless Dirac nodes on the surface, yet only two of them are energy-wise equivalent and have an offset energy compared to the third. If a tunable chemical potential is used and the surface states contain electron-hole pockets of similar size, strong interactions may drive the system into rotational symmetry breaking nematic, or translation symmetric breaking excitonic spin- or charge-density-wave phases, contingent on the relative chirality of the Dirac cone. Thinking about realistic surface band structure, we inspect the corresponding Ginzburg-Landau theory and calculate the mean-field phase diagram for interacting surface states. In addition to the mean-field theory, this system can also be described by a two-component isotropic Ashkin-Teller model at finite temperature, and the phase diagram for this model is outlined. Our theories provide a possible insight into the current measurements which have noticed a two-fold symmetric magnetoresistance and upturn in surface resistivity with tunable gate voltage in SMB@XMath0. Furthermore, our studies could be applicable to other cubic topological insulators, like ytterbium hexaboride (YBB@XMath0) and plutonium hexaboride (PUB@XMath0).", "label": "gpt3re"}

{"text": "The use of genetically modified mice facilitates our understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind various neurological pathologies such as spinal cord injury (SCI). Traditional freehand acting to design a laceration model of SCI typically generates irregular injuries, which can involve either crush or contusion elements. Therefore, an innovative technique was developed to counteract this issue. Our cervical laceration SCI model combats the challenges posed by the freehand approach, with cervical vertebral stabilization secured through vertebral facet fixation, improved exposure of the spinal cord, as well as the creation of a reproducible laceration on the spinal cord through the use of an oscillating blade, with an accuracy of 0.01 mm in depth, and without incurring any contusion. In comparison to standard SCI laceration methods such as the freehand use of a scalpel or scissors, our procedure yields consistent lesions. This approach is invaluable for research into axonal regeneration of the corticospinal, rubrospinal, and dorsal ascending fibers.", "label": "gpt3re"}

We examined the correlation between CAD events in 4092 individuals and identified four independent metabolites associated with CAD (sphingomyelin (28:1), lysophosphatidylcholine (18:2), lysophosphatidylcholine (18:1), and monoglyceride (18:2)) independent of main CAD risk elements. We found that while monoglycerides were linked to c-reactive proteins and body mass index, lysophosphatidylcholines were connected to less evidence of subclinical CAD in an extra of 1010 participants and had a different pattern. A connection between monoglycerides and CAD independent of triglycerides was also observed. Based on the Mendelian randomization analysis, we observed a weak yet positive correlation (odds ratio per unit increase in standard deviation in monog=1.11, p-value=0.05) for CAD. Our research confirms the relationship of the metabolome with coronary artery disease and illuminates its biological mechanism of CAD phenomena, as we identified the aforementioned metabolites and their clinical implications.", "label": "gpt3re"}

Records of all women born in Denmark between 1962 and 1991 were linked to death certificates, allowing for the calculation of mortality rates based on a first pregnancy outcome (delivery, miscarriage, abortion, and late abortion). When taking into account age and birth year, the adjusted cumulative risk of death for those who had a first trimester abortion was significantly higher in the periods up to 10 years, as was the risk for those who had abortions after 12 weeks from one year to 10 years. The risk was significantly higher for cumulative deaths up to 4 years for those who miscarried, and at 10 years as well. These results demonstrate that women who had an early or late abortion had significantly higher mortality rates within 1 through 10 years than women who delivered, with a lesser effect potentially also relative to miscarriage.

{"text": "We hypothesized that blocking the HCN4 hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide gated channels at the cardiac sinus node by the use of Ivabradine would selectively reduce heart rate (HR) and baroreflex HR regulation, while leaving baroreflex control of the muscle sympathetic nerve activity unaffected. 21 healthy men were treated with 27.5mg of Ivabradine or a placebo in a random crossover fashion. Electrocardiogram, blood pressure, and muscle sympathetic nerve activity were recorded at rest and during pharmacological baroreflex testing. The results showed that Ivabradine significantly reduced normalized HR from 65.98.1 to 58.46.2 beats per minute (p<0.001) without changing blood pressure or muscle sympathetic nerve activity. Further, the cardiac and sympathetic baroreflex gains and blood pressure responses to vasoactive drugs were all unchanged upon the usage of Ivabradine. Ivabradine also aggravated bradycardia during baroreflex loading. Therefore, blocking HCN4 with Ivabradine reduced HR, maintaining physiological regulation of HR and muscle sympathetic nerve activity, as well as baroreflex blood pressure buffering. Furthermore, Ivabradine had the potential to aggravate bradycardia during parasympathetic activation. Clinical trial registration URL: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov.

Due to loopback channel estimation error and limitation of analog-to-digital converter, the loopback SI cannot be completely cancelled. To reduce mean square error under a relay transmit power constraint, multiple antennas at the relay need to be used to reduce the loopback SI while employing beamforming to deliver the desired signal transmission. Moreover, the relay beamforming matrix needs to be regularly adjusted because the SI in the previous time slot, when amplified current beamforming matrix, will be added to the received signals from the two sources in the current slot. We further derive the optimally balanced relay beamforming and receive beamforming matrices in closed form based on the minimum mean square error, taking the SI from the first to the current time slot into account. Additionally, beamforming design using only the channel of the latest time slot is proposed.

{"text": "Investigating a toy model of the Standard Model Higgs sector with a chiral U(1)×U(1) symmetry, we searched for asymptotic safety using a functional renormalization group as a non-perturbative tool. The leading-order derivative expansion exhibited admissible non-Gaussian fixed points, arising from a conformal threshold behavior due to self-balanced boson-fermion fluctuations. If present in the full theory, this fixed point would provide a solution to the triviality problem and reduce the hierarchy problem, making both the Higgs mass and top mass a prediction of the theory in terms of the Higgs vacuum expectation value. Unfortunately, the fixed point was destabilized at higher order due to massless Goldstone and fermion fluctuations that are unique to this model and have no analogue in the Standard Model.", "label": "gpt3re"}

To apply the recommendations of his Chinese advisors, he centralized the administrative system, increased the use of paper money, and kept the conventional monopolies on salt and iron. He reinstated the Imperial Secretariat and left the Chinese dynasties' local governance structures unaltered. Although, he turned down suggestions for re-instating the Confucian tests and split Yuan society into three (later four) classes, with Han Chinese being in the most subservient position.

{"text": "During deformation, faulting and other deformational processes can often add new rock units both by deposition and intrusion. The cause of this can be the topographic gradients these events create, causing material to erode from the areas that are increasing in elevation, and then deposited in the rock units going down. Movement along the fault keeps the topographic gradient ongoing and provides larger areas for the material to deposit. Deformational events are usually correlated with volcanic activity and igneous intrusions, with ash and lava accumulating on the surface and dikes, long planar intrusions, entering along cracks. This can lead to the formation of large dike swarms across certain areas or rings of dikes around a lava tube.", "label": "gpt3re"}
{"text": "MicroRNAs (miRs) are small non-coding RNAs that regulate mRNA stability and/or translation. Due to their presence in the circulation and their great resilience, plasma and other biological fluid concentrations of mirs can be used as disease biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis. However, measuring mirs in the circulation is difficult because of problems with sensitivity and specificity. This letter discusses, for the first time, the design and characterization of a regenerative, solid-state localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) sensor utilizing highly sensitive nanostructures (gold nanoprisms) to remove the need for labels or amplifying mirs. Our direct hybridization has enabled us to detect subfemtomolar concentrations of mir-x (x=21 and 10b) in human plasma in pancreatic cancer patients. Our LSPR-based readings showed that the mir levels measured directly in patient plasma were at least two-fold greater than when using RNA extraction and quantification by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Moreover, our LSPR-based measurements showed nearly four-fold higher concentrations of mir-10b than mir-21 in patient plasma. Through this highly sensitive and selective detection approach for assessing mirs in plasma, it may be possible to apply it to a variety of cancer types and disease states, allowing for the development of effective individualized therapy strategies for early disease diagnosis and prognosis.", "label": "gpt3re"}
{"text": "In this paper, it is demonstrated how a weak quantum measurement of diagonal (PM) polarization can be realized through the interference of the horizontal (H) and vertical (V) polarization components of the input beam. The strength of the measurement can be adjusted by rotating the H and V polarizations towards each other. This proficiently produces the measurement back-action without introducing extra decoherence, while the visibility of the interference between the two beams only determines the resolution of the measurement. As confirmed by the experimental results, exceptionally high weak values are achievable, even with relatively low visibilities. Therefore, our proposed method provides a highly resilient implementation of weak measurement, with the reduction of measurement back-action to negligible levels being the essential feature.

We found that WFI J132813.7@xmath0214237 and WFI J161953.3+031909 are, in fact, not transients, but occured due to unfortunate coincidences; the former was the result of a solar system-object and a faint background star coinciding while the latter was simply a cataclysmic variable caught in and out of eclipse. The third candidate, ROTSE3 J160213.1@xmath0021311.7, was identified as an SU UMa-type dwarf nova, whose quiescent brightness is @xmath1 magnitude and outburst amplitude is @xmath2 magnitude.

To remain free from arrest, le Moko confines himself in the Casbah - an area of Algiers even the police are hesitant to enter - until a senior officer comes from Paris in an attempt to capture le Moko. Although the Casbah allows him to remain free, it also serves as a prison which le Moko knows he cannot leave without being arrested. Unfortunately, the movie was a letdown due to incongruent elements. It was hard to believe, for instance, that the police would not enter the Casbah, despite the local commander’s statement at the beginning of the film, and Inspector Slimane’s suggestion that they could get in but not out. Furthermore, the idea that le Moko, a crafty criminal, would be taken in by Gaby (Hedy Lamarr) and entertain the local public with love songs before leaving the Casbah to find her, was far-fetched. The last scenes of the movie, however, ironically had real significance as Pepe leaves the freedom of the Casbah and finds freedom in his eventual death.

{"text": "The introduction of the Western Atlantic ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi into the Black Sea and Sea of Azov via the ballast tanks of ships in the late 1980s has been associated with lower fish catches, likely due to its consumption of both fish larvae and small crustaceans. The invasion of these new territories was made easier by Mnemiopsis's ability to breed quickly, despite a lack of prediction, and its wide range of temperature and salinity tolerance. This was compounded by chronic overfishing, as well as eutrophication of the ecosystem which caused Mnemiopsis populations to increase at an even higher rate. Fortunately, Mnemiopsis was eventually reduced due to the accidental introduction of the North American ctenophore Beroe ovata that ate it, and a cooling of the climate from 1991 to 1993 that slowed the animal's metabolism.

{"text": "This study reports, for the first time, using a serotonin antibody and confocal microscopy, direct serotonergic innervation of the muscle sheath covering the secretory region of the salivary glands of adult tsetse flies (Glossina pallidipes austen). Previous reports note that none of the dipteran species studied up to this point had a muscle sheath covering of the secretory region of the salivary glands. This direct innervation of the salivary gland muscle sheath of tsetse would likely facilitate the rapid deployment of saliva into the host, potentially delaying a host response. Our results suggest that the neuronal and abnormal pattern seen in viral-infected glands of Glossina pallidipes salivary gland hypertrophy virus (GPSGHV) is due to a compensatory increased branching of the neurons of the salivary glands that is associated with the enlarged size of the salivary glands in viral-infected flies. This study also finds, for the first time, serotonin in the cell bodies of the brain and thoracico-abdominal ganglion of adult tsetse.

Both the Cavum Septum Pellucidum (CSP) and CV have both been linked to increased incidents of neurodevelopmental disorders and psychosis, however, there is limited research on the psychopathological significance of solitary isolated CVs. Further examination of this isolated CV, and whether it is an incidental and harmless discovery or a biological risk factor for mental health issues, is recommended in order to resolve any unclear issues. The woman responded well to medication which caused her psychotic symptoms to dissipate within 4-6 weeks. While increase and remission of symptoms occurred after a decrease in her medication, she experienced retention of her improvement at 18 months. Therefore, the finding of this isolated CV, in the context of neuropsychiatric risk, is discussed.", "label": "gpt3re"}
{"text": "Small molecule hormones are essential for the development and upkeep of a mature mammalian organism. On a molecular level, they regulate a wide variety of biological pathways, partially relying on their properties of regulating transcription. These processes include interactions with coactivators, corepressors, basal transcription factors, and other transcription factors in order to control the activity of target genes, which can depend on tissue, age, and developmental and pathological states. This comes into effect 30-60 minutes after the hormonal stimulus is given. Additionally, small molecule hormones impact the function of a cell through several non-genomic mechanisms. This includes their interactions with proteins located in the plasma membrane, the cytoplasm, other cellular membranes, and nonnuclear cellular compartments. Though the identity of such proteins is still being examined, there is evidence to suggest extranuclear fractions of nuclear hormones can be involved. Furthermore, direct interactions with membrane phospholipids and mRNAs are possible. These mechanisms usually show a reaction to hormonal stimulus within seconds or minutes.", "label": "gpt3re"}
{"text": "Approximately 5-15% of kidney transplant recipients develop hypercalcemia, with levels peaking around the third month following the transplant. It is universally accepted that the main cause of this is the post-transplant hyperparathyroidism of moderate to severe degree. Though not yet proven, it is suspected that hypercalcemia can negatively influence other organs or systems, such as causing nephrocalcinosis, vascular calcification, erythrocytosis and pancreatitis. There is not enough evidence to conclude that correcting serum calcium levels would keep these adverse effects from occurring. The best way to prevent hypercalcemia after kidney transplant is to properly treat secondary hyperparathyroidism during the uraemic phase. Whether parathyroidectomy should be performed before or after transplant to prevent or treat the hypercalcemia respectively is still debatable, but the availability of the calcimimetic cinacalcet for post-transplant hyperparathyroidism offers an additional treatment option. More research is needed to better understand the effects of both parathyroidectomy and cinacalcet use in this particular instance, and the results of future randomized controlled trials will bring further insight.", "label": "gpt3re"}
{"text": "Steinocleidomastoid Tumor of Infancy (SCMI), also known as Fibromatosis Colli of Infancy, is a benign, self-limiting disease of newborns. It is characterized by a firm to hard, fusiform mass in the lower and middle portion of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. SCMI often appears during the early perinatal period, typically between the second and fourth week of life. Studies have found a well-recognized association between SCMI and primiparous birth, breech presentation, prolonged difficult labor, and forceps deliveries. Cytology often shows mature fibroblastic cells scattered singly along with degenerated and multinucleated giant muscle cells in a clean background. It is important to differentiate this lesion from other forms of infantile fibromatosis. Fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) provides a time-saving, rapid and reliable diagnostic procedure, which has a bigger role to play in reassuring anxious parents, guiding for conservative treatment, and avoiding surgery.", "label": "gpt3re"}

{"text": "We investigate the escape of cosmic ray (CR) electrons from a supernova remnant (SNR) to interstellar space. We show that, like CR nuclei, CR electrons escape in order from high energies to low energies, though their escape starts later than the beginning of the Sedov phase at an SNR age of @xmath0 and the highest energy of runaway CR electrons is under the knee at @xmath1. The highest energy electrons will be or have already been detected directly by experiments such as AMS-02, CALET, CTA and LHAASO, with H.E.S.S. and MAGIC as a cutoff in the CR electron spectrum. In addition, we calculate the spatial distribution of runaway CR electrons and their radiation spectra around SNRs. Contrary to common belief, the maximum-energy photons of synchrotron radiation around @xmath2 are emitted by runaway CR electrons which have been overtaken by the shock. Inverse Compton scattering by runaway CR electrons can dominate the gamma-ray emission from runaway CR nuclei via pion decay, which are both visible by CTA and LHAASO as a signal of the cosmic ray origin and the magnetic fluctuation intensifying around the SNR. Finally, we discuss middle-aged and/or old SNRs as unidentified very-high-energy gamma-ray sources. Topics included in this paper are acceleration of particles, cosmic rays, gamma rays, shockwaves and supernova remnants.", "label": "gpt3re"}

It was previously reported that patients with progressive TB had high levels of LL-37 and HNP-1 in their circulating cells, while those with latent TB had no differences compared to those with purified protein derivative (PPD) and healthy QFT individuals. 26 TB household contact persons between the ages of 26 and 58, who were both TST and QFT positive and had latent TB infection for at least two years, were recruited for the study. AMP production by polymorphonuclear cells was detected using flow cytometry, and the correlation between TST and QFT values assessed.

Our scheme is based on the weak coupling of two external quantum dots to the data bus. We show that the data bus has an energy gap between the ground state and first excited state induced by the impurity. By connecting two quantum dots to two sites of the data bus, the system can facilitate high fidelity and long-distance quantum state transfer. Numerical simulations on a finite system demonstrate that the numerical and analytical results on the effective coupling strength agree. In addition, we investigate the robustness of the quantum communication protocol to disorder in the couplings between nearest-neighbor quantum dots.

The research design and methods involved searching for published studies prior to June 2009 from MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Embase, before contacting authors and asking them to provide individual patient data or perform pre-defined analyses. The findings revealed that, on average, there was a 5% increase in the odds of type 1 diabetes in childhood per 5-year increment in maternal age (95% CI: 29; P = 0.006), although there was heterogeneity among studies (heterogeneity I2 = 70%). In studies found to be of low risk of bias, the risk of diabetes was 10% higher per each 5-year increase in maternal age. After adjusting for potential confounders, the estimates remained the same. Overall, the results suggest a weak but significant association between maternal age and the risk of type 1 diabetes in children, with the relationship between the two varying across studies. A small percentage of the increasing incidence of type 1 diabetes in children may be attributable to increases in maternal age.", "label": "gpt3re"}

{"text": "Our recent research has demonstrated that American Ginseng (AG) and its hexane fraction (HAG) have the ability to induce apoptosis of inflammatory cells and suppress mouse colitis through a p53-mediated mechanism. As a result, we investigated our hypothesis that HAG suppresses colitis through a p53 mechanism. We found that p53 had a limited impact and that HAG could still cause apoptosis of the inflammatory cells and suppress colitis in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, we further found that HAG could cause cell cycle arrest of HCT116 colon cancer cells in vitro independent of p53 status. This is significant as ulcerative colitis is a debilitating condition that carries a high risk of colon cancer, and p53 mutations are commonly found in colitis-related colon cancers.

{"text": "By utilizing Schwinger's method, a general expression of the spectral distribution and characteristic frequency of a charged particle in arbitrary motion can be obtained to analyze the general radiation emission mechanism from said particle when moving in a curved inhomogeneous magnetic field. The consideration of the gradient makes the curved vacuum magnetic field compatible with the Maxwell equations, introducing a non-trivial term to the transverse drift velocity and hence to the general radiation spectrum. The radiation patterns of the ultrarelativistic electron can be determined via evaluating the particle's acceleration. In order to gain the same results, an effective electromagnetic field that fuses the magnetic field with the fictitious electric field associated to the curvature and drift motion also can be defined. All physical traits of the radiation can be obtained by substituting the constant magnetic field with the effective one. In this unified framework, we consider the power, angular distribution, and spectral distribution of all three components (synchrotron, curvature, and gradient) of the radiation in the classical and quantum domain. Additionally, this approach lets us study the effects of the inhomogeneities and curvature of the magnetic field on the radiative transitions rates of electrons between low-lying Landau levels and the ground state in the quantum domain.", "label": "gpt3re"}

{"text": "We study the thermoelectric properties and heat-to-work conversion performance of an interacting, multi-level quantum dot (QD) weakly coupled to electronic reservoirs in the sequential tunneling regime. Using master equations for the probabilities of occupation, we calculate the charge and heat currents in the linear response regime. Assuming a generic multi-terminal setup and for low temperatures (quantum limit), we obtain analytical expressions for the transport coefficients that take into account the interplay between interactions (charging energy) and level quantization. For systems with two and three terminals, we derive formulas for the power factor and figure of merit for a QD-based heat engine, identifying optimal working conditions to maximize output power and efficiency of heat-to-work conversion. Beyond the linear response regime, we focus on the two-terminal setup, examining the thermoelectric non-linear coefficients in the presence of large temperature and voltage biases and looking at the breakdown of the Onsager reciprocal relation between thermopower and Peltier coefficient. We investigate the conditions required to optimize the performance of a heat engine, finding that in the quantum limit, output power and efficiency at maximum power can almost be maximized simultaneously by choosing appropriate values of electrochemical potential and bias voltage. Lastly, we investigate how energy level degeneracy can enhance the output power.", "label": "gpt3re"}

{"text": "Due to their ubiquitous nature, Fano fluctuations are anticipated to affect the response of Superconducting Nanowire Single-Photon Detectors (SNSPDs). We predict that the Photon Counting Rate (@xmath0) as a function of Bias Current (@xmath1) in SNSPDs is described by a combination of a transverse coordinate-dependent Complementary Error Function and fluctuation in the energy portion between quasiparticles and phonons during the energy down-conversion cascade. These factors are responsible for the finite width, @xmath2, of the @xmath0 vs. @xmath1. This holds true for both narrow-nanowire SNSPDs (where the local responses are uniform, with fano-fluctuations dominating) and for wide-nanowire SNSPDs (where the fano-fluctuations smear the singularities in the transition part of @xmath0 due to vorticity).

This lack of recovery time ended up costing the Eagles, as manager Sam Allardyce put it: “The lack of energy the players had showed massively... the players were trying their best, but they were not physically able to reach their usual levels.” Angel Rangel of Swansea scored the winning goal in the 88thminute, after Palace already lost 2-0 to Arsenal on Sunday. Allardyce confessed he should have made more than the two changes he did, admitting, “We struggled to keep up with Swansea – we hadn’t recovered properly.” Alan Curtis, coach of Swansea, also acknowledged that fatigue had been an issue. He said, “We had 24 hours more rest compared to them and that may have made a difference.” Likewise, Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger and Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe shared the same sentiments. Wenger remarked, “We had three or four players we had to play tonight that we had to wait until the warm-up to see if they could play. That’s the problem with only 48 hours between games…” While Howe noted, “I'm not going to deny it had an impact.” In contrast, Chelsea, who tops the Premier League standings and will face Tottenham tomorrow, had the most rest during this time frame. However, Blues manager Antonio Conte surmised that the complaints were due to teams’ positions, saying, “I think that now they are angry for our position, not for the fixtures.”", "label": "gpt3re"}

Study samples divided into two groups of 10 each were irrigated with 3% sodium hypochlorite solution followed by either 17% EDTA or 17% EDTAC solution. AH Plus was mixed and a controlled volume droplet (0.1ml) placed on the dried samples. The contact angle was measured using a dynamic contact angle analyzer, and results were analyzed using SPSS 21.0 and 2 sample t-test. Results revealed an obvious significant difference in the contact angle of AH Plus formed to the dentine irrigated with the two different regimens, where it demonstrated significantly lower contact angle with the one having EDTAC as the final irrigant compared to the one with EDTA (p<0.05). The conclusion then being that the combination of NaOCl with either EDTA or EDTAC solution as a final irrigant highly affects the dentine wettability and contact angle of a sealer; where EDTAC as the final irrigant offers better dentine wettability for AH Plus to promote its flow and adhesion.", "label": "gpt3re"}

An elective surgical intervention was performed with the aid of 5-aminolevulinic acid fluorescence (blue 400, OPMI) and intraoperative IRT brain mapping (LWIR, 1.25 mrad IFOV, 0.05C NETD). Upon dura opening, the surface appeared normal; however, IRT highlighted an area with a significantly cooler temperature (T 1.01C), directly corresponding to the cortical epicenter of the lesion.

The postoperative cell loss was measured at 43.8%, however the UCVA and BCVA improved postoperatively and were found to stabilize or have a low rate of cell loss during follow-ups. 61.9% of the patients required re-bubbling and 17 (23.9%) had to replace the lamella due to its failure or malfunction. In conclusion, combining the advantages of DSEK/DSAEK and DMEK, this hybrid technique of DMEnK-S resulted in good visual outcomes, good manipulation of the lamella during implantation, and is an effective treatment for endothelial dysfunction of various causes.

{"text": "Foreign policy has been in the hands of the president throughout France's Fifth Republic and Nicolas Sarkozy has left his mark. If Francois Hollande were to win on Sunday, how might this affect foreign policy? Veteran French analyst Dominique Moisi believes the approach and experience would differ greatly as Hollande is not accustomed to dealing with international issues.  Sarkozy leaned toward a more visible foreign policy and to have France take charge in event. For example, intervening in 2008 between Russia and Georgia and France's military action against Libya in 2011. Even though France was not acting alone, Sarkozy pushed for France to be the driving force behind foreign policy goals. People have rejected Sarkozy’s style, so Moisi suggests a different approach may arise from Hollande. He adds that Holland could still change his perspective in office. When it comes to dealing with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and other European partners Francois Heisbourg from FRS believes Hollande’s position will be strong. Hollande wishes to grow the economy and opposes the approach Merkel has taken to austerity. Merkel had openly shown a preference for Sarkozy’s re-election, believing his alliance with Germany is what’s best. However, it is because of the current European economy and France’s downgraded rating, Heisbourg suggests Hollande can bargain. As Hollande worked closely with Jacques Delors in his early years, Moisi claims he has an understanding of the importance of Europe that people find credible. He remains hopeful that the UK, France’s closest ally in defence, will keep the partnership. There is a long-standing history of France maintaining a “more atlanticist” approach to foreign policy. The personal relationship between Barack Obama and Nicolas Sarkozy was competitive and Moisi does not expect a complete shift. On the Middle East, Hollande will maintain the ties Sarkozy made with Israel, but with a change of style. Despite a degree of change under Francois Hollande in certain areas, both Heisbourg and Moisi agree there would be continuity in foreign and defence policies. There has not been a great emphasis on these issues during the presidential campaign as Sarkozy’s record has been seen as globally positive.", "label": "gpt3re"}
{"text": "I was thoroughly entertained by Margaret Atwood's excellent novel, 'The Robber Bride', and I was delighted to find there was a film adaptation. The movie followed a man framed for murder by a vengeful woman and his former law enforcement pal and journalist, who tries to clear his name by investigating her sinister female friends. Due to the awkward plotting in the source material, this adaptation focuses on the story of the two men who become the victims of the women's scheming. This is a bit off-putting since the characters of the novel are largely pushed aside to make way for the dimensional development of these men's stories, and if I hadn't read the novel, I likely would have enjoyed it more. However, for anyone seeking a plethora of characterization, prose and layered plot, it is definitely worthwhile to stick with the novel instead. In essence, the movie adaptation takes the plot from the novel and subdues it, adding more male centered perspectives.

{"text": "Contrasting against laws that could potentially limit market access, the Court of Justice has established a principle that selling arrangements would be deemed to not be covered by the TFEU article 34, given that they are applied equally to sellers and have the same impact in fact. An example of this in Keck and Mithouard saw two importers challenged with a French competition law making it illegal to sell Picon beer below a certain wholesale price. The intention of the law was to prevent extreme competition, not to impede trade. The Court of Justice held that since this selling arrangement impacted all sellers evenly and did not change the content of the product, it was beyond the scope of article 34 and not deemed to need a justification. Though, situations in which sellers from another EU Member State are striving to enter the market could lead to unequal effects in fact, such as prohibitions of promotion and advertising. The nation of Sweden had restrictions on broadcasts targeting children under twelve and deceptive advertisements for skin care products, which were considered valid per article 36 and mandatory requirements. Nevertheless, complete bans on promotion might be unbalanced if advertising is the only means for a trader to achieve a foothold in the market, which was the opinion of the Court of Justice in the Konsumentombudsmannen v De Agostini case. When looking at a restriction on marketing and advertising of alcoholic beverages directed at radiobroadcasts, magazines and TV, the Court of Justice in Konsumentombudsmannen v Gourmet AB suggested that a total ban might fit into the article 34 classification if promotion was the sole way to overcome the traditional consumer behaviour and local customs of buying the product. To guard against consumer manipulation, distortion of personal behaviour, misleading or forceful methods, the EU has harmonised its laws with the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive, which outlines a list of activities which are considered to be unfair. To ensure the standards across the continent, states are going to have to recognise each other's regulations, whilst the EU has initiated a drive to reach an agreement on minimum best practice. It is hoped this will avoid too much laxity in terms of regulation, whilst simultaneously granting consumers access to goods from countries throughout the European Union.", "label": "gpt3re"}

Another 36 people were taken to a hospital, with seven identified as being in critical condition. Witnesses of the Birmingham raid have reported being locked out of their properties for more than one hour. Farha Makanvand, the owner of the raided flat, stated he did not who the tenants were as they had come through a letting agency.25-year-old Stuart Bailey, who resides four doors down, shared he encountered multiple armed officers who had firearms while going for a drink with a friend. Mampreet Kaur, another witness, stated she and her baby had to lock themselves in their residence due to police raiding the flat. Another neighbor recalled seeing roughly a dozen armed police wearing bulletproof vests and helmets, and attempting to break open the doors. A spokesperson for Enterprise confirmed that a Hyundai taken from their Spring Hill depot in Birmingham was used in the attack. Moreover, the West Midlands police emphasized an increased security in Birmingham in the upcoming days due to the events, although no new or developing intelligence had been uncovered. The Birmingham Faith Leaders' Group publicly denounced the attack, emphasizing that such actions are taken by individuals rather than whole communities, and encouraged people to strive for better and stronger relations particularly in this difficult time.", "label": "gpt3re"}

{"text": "The Adeno-associated Virus (AAV) has been developed as a promising gene therapy vector for humans, particularly recombinant AAV (rAAV) which is able to cross the plasma membrane, endosomal membranes and nuclear envelope (NE). However, its transduction mechanism has yet to be thoroughly explored at the single viral particle level. In this study, high-speed super-resolution single-point edge-excitation sub-diffraction (SPEED) microscopy is employed to map the events of single rAAV2 particles infecting live human cells with a resolution of 912 nm and 220 ms. The data reveals that rAAV2 particles are imported through Nuclear Pore Complexes (NPCs) rather than through NE budding. Further, 17% of the rAAV2 molecules from the cytoplasm successfully traverse the NPC to reach the nucleoplasm, indicating that NPC acts as a selective pathway for AAV delivery. This study suggests a new pathway that can be used to improve AAV vectors for human gene therapy.", "label": "gpt3re"}

{"text": "We investigate the CNGS beam's capability to restrict the parameter space of a model with one sterile neutrino that is isolated from three active neutrinos by a mass-squared difference, $\\Delta m_{41}^2$. Our analysis is done with the Opera detector and we can upgrade it to include a detailed simulation of the Icarus detector. We find that the channel with the most potential for constraining the sterile neutrino parameter space is $\\nu_\\mu \\rightarrow \\nu_\\mu$ since the active-sterile mixing angle that governs the oscillation is the least constrained by existing experiments and this signal is what both Opera and Icarus are designed for and yields a very low background. Our analysis also takes into account $\\nu_\\mu \\rightarrow \\nu_e$ oscillations and we come to the conclusion that the CNGS potential to look for sterile neutrinos is limited with the current beam intensity, but with a 2-10 times increase in the neutrino flux this potential can be significantly improved. The data from both channels allows us to further constrain the four-neutrino model parameter space regardless of the value of $\\Delta m_{41}^2$ (i.e. even when the oscillations subservient to this mass-squared difference are averaged out). Additionally, we check that the constraint of $\\Delta m_{41}^2$ that CNGS can put on is unaltered by the existence of sterile neutrinos.", "label": "gpt3re"}

The script was splendid, the performances were outstanding (with Reese Witherspoon and Sam Waterston standing out, but the acting as a whole was truly wonderful), the direction and cinematography magical, and the music score subtle yet powerful (as opposed to some Miramax scores which are overly manipulative).

{"text": "Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) and Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) are two multidisciplinary liver disorders that often appear alongside Type 2 Diabetes or Metabolic Syndrome, which are characterized by insulin resistance. To effectively treatment these conditions, it is important to not only focus on the cardiometabolic abnormalities, but also the associated liver diseases. In the last decade, research has indicated that Metformin, Thiazolidinediones, Vitamin E, Ezetimibe, N-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids, Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) blockers and anti-obesity drugs might improve these pathophysiological disorders and clinical parameters. Therefore, insulin sensitizers, antioxidative agents, Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1) inhibitors, RAS blockers, and drugs targeting the central nervous system could be potential pharmacotherapies for NAFLD and possibly NASH. However, due to the long-term treatment period (potentially for years), the efficacy, safety, and effectiveness of these medicines are yet to be determined. Meanwhile, there is also no comprehensive research in place for assessing the effectiveness of lipid lowering drugs (such as Statins, Fibrates, and NPC1L1 inhibitors) to treat NAFLD.

In conclusion, if anyone says that this heart-warming comedy isn't worth a watch, I completely disagree. Not only was the film great, the English countryside was truly beautiful. It's the perfect two hours to spend with friends.", "label": "gpt3re"}
{"text": "The use of Callithrix jacchus (common marmoset) as a non-human primate model for human diseases, from autoimmune to infectious diseases, has increased. To maximize the potential of these models, effective comparisons to the human host must be made. To achieve this, reagents primarily meant for human cells were used to analyse the phenotype and activation status of essential cells types and cytokines in naive and infected marmosets. Cell suspensions of blood, spleen and lung were analyzed, and it was observed that the percentage of lymphocytes in the marmosets' blood, T cells (63%), B cells (25%) and NK cells (12%) was similar to that of a human. In comparison to mice, the amount of neutrophils in the blood of marmosets was more similar to human values. The response to systemic or inhalation infection also varied from tissue to tissue and the major variations were found in cells associated with the innate immune responses. This work is significant as it enables the understanding of the immune response in marmosets and gives support for the use of marmosets as models for infectious diseases.", "label": "gpt3re"}
{"text": "The debate is ongoing as to whether China's economy will continue to stay propped up for the long term, or if it will succumb to a major economic disruption - closer to what the Austrian Theory predicts. Optimistic observers believe that the Chinese economy will eventually grow naturally to support its current capital structure and that downturns will only be minor hiccups. Pessimists, on the other hand, fear that the government's attempts to prop up investments with further subsidies could limit consumption and distort resource allocation, damning the Chinese economy to stagnation. Either way, looking at history, it is rare for a country to experience three decades of rapid growth without eventually taking a hit. With no definite answer in sight, all we can do is wait and see what surprises the future holds for China.", "label": "gpt3re"}

Results showed that 32.5% of the subjects had significant hip pathology, including hip osteoarthritis grades 3 and 4 and avascular necrosis stages I and II, along with other morphologic aberrations. Regarding acetabulum or hip joint visualization in KUB radiographs, only 1.8% had acetabulum visualization only and 4.1% had hip joint visualization, while 94.1% displayed femoral neck and lesser trochanter visualization. The visualization rate of the hip joint was sufficiently high (98.2%). It was also demonstrated that the hip visualization rate varied significantly depending on the patient's height (p < 0.05).

Lonely on set, Boll gathered three of his countrymen to join him: Til Schweiger, Udo Kier and Ralf Moeller - all three star in the movie. Jack Carver - played by Til Schweiger - starts his bizarre story. There are those who claim that his performance isn't quite up to Carver's agenda, however since we only saw him in first person view, we don't really know how he looks like while in action. The storyline of the film is wild; Udo Kier stars as the insidious Dr. Krieger, doing secret research on a Vancouver-esque island. There are no palm trees in sight and Far Cry is, for sure, set to be a disappointment. There are some inspiring boat and fighting scenes available, along with an unwelcome companion for Carver.

Thus, the amount of material to be dredged could be much greater than initially assumed. Moreover, cyclones could require reevaluation of the amount of dredged material to be dumped.

{"text": "Going into viewing \"Cama de Gato\", I had heard it was the worst Brazilian movie of the decade, but I decided to give it a chance due to the impressive feat of first-time director/producer/writer Alexandre Stockler, shooting the film on video for just US$4,000, and having the movie exhibited in theaters with no major sponsors or production companies backing it (unfortunately, it was soon clear why). The chances of this movie living up to expectations shrink to zero in the first 10 minutes: it is unbelievably preposterous and verbose, ideologically fanatical and technically catastrophic, portraying Brazilian upper-middle class youth as spoiled neo-Nazis with a penchant for bad sex, drugs and violence, and implies they are closeted gays. The technical quality of visuals and audio draws similarities to the worst amateur stuff seen on YouTube, but unlike YouTube videos, \"Cama de Gato\" lasts 92 minutes of non-stop hysteria and clumsiness, with nothing to make it funny-bad. The plot is unoriginal - bored young people wanting to have fun results in gang-rape, spanking, murder, and the accidental death of one of the boy's mothers. Clearly, Larry Clark's films have heavily influenced \"Cama de Gato\"; however, Clark's films are high-class masterpieces compared to this film. Stockler proves to be a narcissist control-freak, trying to impose his moralist ideas on the audience through repetition, and making sure to add subtitles with smart and cutesy comments. He exhibits no regard for technique, and fails to provide even the minimum visual or narrative structure. The dialogue is terribly banal, the plot existing solely to express hatred for the characters, and the visuals and sound are appalling. The immensely promising Caio Blat has been wasted too, taking part in graphic sexploitation scenes and delivering an over-the-top performance. The film begins and ends with interviews showing the awfulness of middle-class life, though Stockler seems to be making fun out of the people instead of truly trying to understand. \"Cama de Gato\" is the worst of what Brazilian cinema has to offer and is best kept unwatched, unmentioned and buried. It gives detractors of Brazilian cinema a good case to argue against it, while the dogmatic self-righteousness, poor technique, and mind-boggling boredom of the film make it harmful in an insidious way.", "label": "gpt3re"}

Further, a graphene bilayer is even more effective by blocking the diffusion of oxygen with a much higher energy barrier. While oxygen molecules are weakly bound to bare graphene surfaces, they become extremely inactive. On the other hand, oxygen atoms easily dissociate and stick to low coordinated carbon atoms at the edges of a vacancy, which drastically reduces the oxidation barrier and hence weakens the protection from oxidation provided by graphene coatings. Our findings suggest that graphene could be exploited as a corrosion-resistant coating for further studies.", "label": "gpt3re"}

{"text": "Swimming is a vital component of ARK: Survival Evolved players as they have the capability to mount tamed creatures and swim on their backs, allowing them to traverse quickly and reach areas not easily accessible without special swimming equipment. Swimming also enables access to underwater caves. Still, swimming consumes a character's oxygen, so they will periodically have to come up to the surface or use swimming apparatus. Moving on the surface of the water is slower than actually submerging. Eating Lazarus Chowder will decrease considerably the rate oxygen is consumed for 10 minutes. Certain creatures can be ridden by players such as Amphibious Anaerobic and Surface. These creatures include the Carnivores (Angler, Baryonyx, Beelzebufo, Plesiosaur, Sarco, and Spinosaur),Herbivores (Carbonemys and Castoroides), and the Carnivore Benthic creatures (Ichthyosaurus, Megalodon, Manta, and Mosasaurus). Not all of them can swim on land—the player must open the radial menu to ride Diplocaulus while the dino is still in water. Once it ascends to a point where walking is required, the player will have to dismount.", "label": "gpt3re"}

To fund their costly revolution, colonist went into temporary debt and ended up printing paper banknotes, leading to inflation. Subsequently, this was addressed in the US Constitution by the Article I, Section 10, wherein states were prohibited from coining money, emitting bills of credit or making any thing but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts. As a result, the Coinage Act was passed in 1792, denominating coins to be minted. When other countries, such as Germany and Hungary, experienced war and debt, they resorted to printing paper money and eventually, hyperinflation. This ultimately caused further damages, with Germany leading to a Nazi takeover.", "label": "gpt3re"}
{"text": "We investigate the Interacting Self-Avoiding Trail (ISAT) model on a Bethe Lattice with general coordination @xmath0 and on a Husimi lattice constructed from squares and coordination @xmath1. Exact grand-canonical solutions of the model are acquired, factoring in that up to @xmath2 monomers may occupy a site and a weight of @xmath3 is assigned to a @xmath4-fold visited site. Complex phase diagrams, with Non-Polymerized (NP), Regular Polymerized (P), and Dense Polymerized (DP) phases, separated by continuous and discontinuous transition lines (or surfaces), are revealed. For the Bethe Lattice with @xmath1 and @xmath5, the collapse transition is characterized by a bicritical point and the collapsed phase is linked to the Dense Polymerized phase (solid-like), rather than the Regular Polymerized phase (liquid-like). The same conclusion is reached for the Husimi lattice, which explains the discrepancy between the collapse transition for ISAT and for Interacting Self-Avoiding Walks on the square lattice. For @xmath6 and @xmath7 (on Bethe Lattice only), an even more complicated phase diagram and mapping in the canonical ensemble is obtained, featuring two critical planes, two coexistence surfaces, and two tricritical and two critical end-point lines that culminate at a multicritical point. These outcomes are compared to simulational results on regular lattices.", "label": "gpt3re"}

Each of the characters, who were typical American teens, were introduced in detail, and by the time of the climax, we had a better understanding of their individual personalities. The film slowly gained pace - just like the exciting build-up at the start of a roller coaster - before eventually reaching its horrifying climax. Steve Johnson's make-up effects were amazingly well-done, with the same quality as much bigger budgeted films. Kevin Tenney's work was remarkable, full of surprises and spine-chilling set-ups. The humorous, occasionally cheesy, style marks it as a pure 80s horror, as opposed to the darker atmosphere of earlier horror classics like \"Night of the Living Dead\" and \"Hills Have Eyes.\" True horror fans must watch this - it would create a great double bill with the 1999 remake of \"House on the Haunted Hill\".

Through an open system approach, we look into the effect of asymmetries and the minute electron-phonon interaction on the general dynamical characteristics of the charge distribution (or polarization) of these systems. Our results indicate that the system's reaction to the driving field is enhanced at lower temperatures (and/or weaker phonon coupling) but diminishes with the increase of temperature and asymmetry. To learn more about the conflict between coherent evolution and dissipative processes, in addition to researching the temporal polarization, we look into the linear entropy of the system.", "label": "gpt3re"}
{"text": "We have revisited the spectral properties of the two-body random ensemble studied thirty years ago by re-analyzing its spectral properties with longer spectra. At the center of the spectra, the original results are largely confirmed and we demonstrate that the non-ergodicity is largely due to the variance of the lowest moments of the spectra. The extended spectra also allow us to test and to reach the boundaries of validity of French’s correction for the number variance. At the edges of the spectra, we discuss unfolding in more detail. We find that with a Gaussian unfolding of each spectrum, the nearest neighbor spacing distribution between the ground state and first exited state is stable. With such an unfolding, the distribution tends to a semi-Poisson distribution as the spectra become longer. In comparison with the nuclear table ensemble, such an unfolding gives reasonable results when the data is normalized with the same procedure used with the data.", "label": "gpt3re"}

{"text": "To investigate the effect of local sublattice imbalance on low energy spectra of @xmath0 quantum antiferromagnets, we analyze the @xmath0 quantum nearest neighbor Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the coordination 3 Cayley tree using the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) technique for generic tree graphs. We observe a quasi-degenerate set of low-lying states in the bond-centered Cayley tree, along with an ``anomalous'' singlet-triplet finite size gap scaling. To explain the wavefunction ansatz of the first excited state from the many-body ground state, we consider the single mode approximation (SMA), which has a remarkable overlap with the DMRG wavefunction. Our analysis of the ground-state entanglement spectrum reveals the presence of ``giant spins'' arising out of sublattice imbalance, which helps us explain the scaling of the finite size spin gap. Furthermore, the Schwinger boson mean field theory has been adapted to non-uniform lattices, which yields ground states that are spatially inhomogeneous in the mean field parameters.", "label": "gpt3re"}
{"text": "By using a recently developed semi-analytical approach - `` Self-consistent Local Random Phase Approximation (SC-LRPA) '' - to solve the effective Heisenberg Hamiltonian, we calculate Curie temperatures and study the stability of ferromagnetism in diluted magnetic materials. This approach includes effects of spin and thermal fluctuations, as well as geometric disorder, while previous mean-field treatments used in the literature largely overestimated both the Curie temperatures and the stability of ferromagnetism as a function of carrier density. This is due to the underestimation of effects of frustration found in the RKKY oscillations. We argue that using a weakly-disordered RKKY exchange to model ferromagnetism in diluted III-V systems is inconsistent with the observation of ferromagnetism over a wide region of itinerant carrier densities. We propose a resolution to this issue by taking RKKY-like interactions between resonant states close to the Fermi level.", "label": "gpt3re"}

{"text": "A team of researchers from England contend that reducing the use of antibiotics can be beneficial in curbing the risk of antibiotic resistance. As suggested by Prof Martin Llewelyn of the Brighton and Sussex Medical School, there is evidence that taking short courses of antibiotics - such as three to five days - can be as useful in treating several infections as long courses of antibiotics. Nevertheless, there are exceptions to this rule like in the case of TB infections, for which one antibiotic may cause rapid resistance. Thus, the researchers argue for tailored prescriptions to each infection and each individual. Additionally, hospitals are increasingly monitoring the need for antibiotics and seeing if short courses of drugs are appropriate for the condition. However, further research is needed to ascertain whether stopping treatment once feeling better is feasible. Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, a leader at the Royal College of General Practitioners warns against altering behaviour based on only one study. She maintains that while recommended courses of antibiotics are addressed to individual conditions, it is also important that patients complete their full course of antibiotics, which may be shorter than expected. Kieran Hand, spokesman for the Royal Pharmaceutical Society, notes that further research is needed before any alternative advice such as 'stop when you feel better' can be recommended.

We refer to the normal state as a fractionalized Fermi liquid (FL*), with quasiparticles commonly associated with electrons being coupled to the fractionalized excitations of the fluctuating antiferromagnet. The pocket Fermi surfaces enclosing a total area equal to the dopant density are located away from the magnetic Brillouin zone boundary, and this violation of the Luttinger theorem is correlated with a `species doubling' of the quasiparticles. We introduce phenomenological theories of the pairing of these quasiparticles, and show that a wide range of mean-field theories typically exhibit a nodal-antinodal `dichotomy': the combined effects of local antiferromagnetism and pairing leads to a small gap near the nodes of the @xmath1-wave pairing along the Brillouin zone diagonals, and a large gap in the antinodal region.", "label": "gpt3re"}

I want to get a better understanding of what the Physx indicator is telling players when they are in the game and when heavy particle and fluid effects are active. Some people have reported that the Physx indicator shows GPU while others report that CPU is the one being used. For instance, mine does not show Physx - GPU even though my GTX 1080 Classified has been set to use it. Additionally, many users of monitoring software have noticed low CPU/GPU usage even when Physx effects are intense. Nvidia and Gearbox previously said that Physx would run well on Borderlands 2 but the issues we are now facing have shown that is not true. This was released 5 years ago, so unfortunately, no help is likely to come from either Nvidia or Gearbox. However, I found a fascinating article on PhysxInfo.com from Zogrim who spoke to the developers that worked on Physx. He reports that \"[Borderlands] is not using APEX, just default PhysX Cloth and PhysX Particle System implementations\". This is where YOU can help me.

{"text": "The infiltration of leukocytes in tumors is often the result of the pro-tumor, pro-angiogenic phenotype that is induced by the cancer microenvironment. This polarization has been observed in a variety of myeloid cells, especially macrophages. Natural Killer (NK) cells also comprise a population of innate immune cells that can invade tumors, however the role of NK cells in tumor advancement and angiogenesis has yet to be fully clarified. Studies have displayed that both tumor-infiltrating NK cells (here referred to as TINKs) and tumor-associated NK cells (altered peripheral NK cells, which we refer to as TANKs) are significantly weakened in their capacity to attack tumors. New data suggest that these cells may have a protumorigenic potential, as well as being pro-angiogenic. In this review, we discuss the properties of TINKs and TANKs and compare them to NK cells with a physiological pro-angiogenic phenotype, like decidual NK cells. We also address potential sources of TINKs and TANKs, and the immune signals involved in their differentiation and polarization. This seemingly protumorigenic role of TINKs and TANKs presents wide implications of the immune reaction to tumors, ranging from insufficient control of cancer and cancer stem cells, to modified crosstalk with other significant elements of the immune response, such as dendritic cells, to the initiation of cancer angiogenesis. By presenting this newfound information which has yet to be taken into consideration, we can point out potential new avenues for therapeutic interventions involving NK cells as either a target or an ally in oncology.", "label": "gpt3re"}

{"text": "The present study aimed to evaluate the total annual cost due to chronic HCV-related diseases imposed on each patient and their family in Southern Iran. 200 Iranian patients were evaluated for their socioeconomic status, utilization (direct and indirect costs) and treatment costs, as well as work days lost due to the illness, using a structured questionnaire in 2015. Costs of hospital admissions were extracted from Nemazee Hospital databases in Shiraz, Iran, while the outpatient and inpatient expenditures were calculated by the average cost per visit and annual rate of hospital admissions as reported by the patients. Additionally, self-medication and direct non-medical costs were reported. The Human Capital Approach was used to measure the work loss cost. Results suggested that the total annual cost per patient for chronic HCV, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) based on Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) were USD 1625.50, USD 6117.20, and USD 11047.20 respectively in 2015.

The XMM data are compared with observations by ROSAT in 1992, and by ASCA and BeppoSAX in 1996.

We shed light on current hypotheses concerning the coronal source areas of fast and slow wind streams, and how these areas vary in the course of the solar cycle. These source regions are evaluated in the context of recent theoretical models (based on alfvén waves and magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence) that have started to successfully anticipate both the heating and acceleration in fast and slow wind regions with minor free parameters.

Timing of implant placement was immediate in 12.0%, early in 0.5%, and late in 87.4%. The survival rate was 99.1% with a failure rate of 0.8%. Failures occurred more commonly in the mandibular canine to canine region at 1.1%. Overall, 10.1% of patients experienced complications; 18.3% in the maxillary canine to canine, 8.9% in the mandibular canine to canine, 18.1% in the maxillary first premolar to first premolar, and 9.5% in the mandibular first premolar to first premolar.

However, Thierry Baudet of the No campaign believes that the EU is expanding powers recklessly. The association agreement must be ratified by all members of the EU, meaning a No vote could hinder the deal. Depending on the outcome, the government would then have to present it to parliament for consideration. Nevertheless, low voter turnout would allow the politicians to disregard the result.

{"text": "Jake Rosenfield, a sociologist from the University of Washington, believes the decrease in union membership in the United States is a greater factor in the growth of income disparity compared to modern innovations like technological advancement and globalization, which other industrialized countries did not face an escalated level of inequality for. He notes that the countries with strong union representation, predominantly in Scandinavia, show lowly level of inequity, thus concluding: \"the traditional correlation is simple to recognize; the cross-national evidence is clear; heightened inequality is closely linked with weak labor movements, and vice-versa.\"", "label": "gpt3re"}
{"text": "An investigation into a forgery operation resulted in the arrest of five foreigners and left one police officer shot and injured. A quantity of fake passports were found in a Phra Kanong district flat, comprising three English-speaking people, two Americans and one Briton, along with a Burmese maid and her husband. At the time of the raid, one suspect opened fire on the police, injuring the officer. Subsequently, a body of a foreign man with blond hair was found in one of the downstairs freezers, cut into six pieces and stuffed into a black bag. Bangkok police chief Sanit Mahathavorn stated that the suspects were now being quested at a police station in south-west Bangkok. The trade of forged and stolen passports is a major business in Thailand, with the Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 two years ago showing two Iranians to be travelling on stolen passports bought in Thailand.", "label": "gpt3re"}
{"text": "We investigate the application of analytic perturbation theory to the Gross-Llewellyn Smith sum rule. We focus on the evolution and renormalization scheme dependence of the analytic three-loop QCD correction of this sum rule, finding the results are largely unaffected by the chosen renormalization scheme, and produce significantly different @xmath0 evolution than what is found in the standard perturbative correction.

{"text": "This film was definitely a success. Even though I'm not a huge baseball fan, the great cast of Danny Glover, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Brenda Fricker, Christopher Lloyd, Tony Danza, and Milton Davis Jr. with their understanding of the sport was very effective in conveying the themes of love, determination, and heart. The plot was believable and had a great, powerful message. Director William Dear and his crew did an amazing job of pulling this film together, considering most sports films draw from true stories or events and often fail to deliver. Despite a few minor flaws, this movie ended up scoring a 10/10 on the perfection scale.", "label": "gpt3re"}
{"text": "The addition of trace molecules into membranes can drastically influence the morphology of coexisting liquid phases and temperature of lipid phase transitions. Through preferential partitioning or mixing into one lipid phase, membrane additives can drastically alter lipid phase dynamics. A minimalistic nearest neighbor model has utilized characteristic differences between these mechanisms to elucidate how slight changes in membrane composition can impact lipid-phase dependent process such as lipid-raft formation, immunological signaling and molecular sorting preceding endocytosis. In low mole fractions (3 mol%); increase in additive concentration can linearly alter the miscibility temperature. Rotationally asymmetric Janus particles can reduce the miscibility transition temperature irrespective of fraction and degree of phase polarization. Whereas, rotationally symmetric additives can increase/decrease miscibility temperature depending on the phase preference. This model is useful in quantifying the effects of membrane additives in terms of lipid phase preference, lipid-raft association and contribution to lipid-phase dependent sorting of molecules.
