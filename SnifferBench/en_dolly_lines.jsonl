{"text": "High salt has been shown to play a role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and systemic lupus erythematosus. In this study, we investigated the effect of high salt on the production of inflammatory mediators by arpe-19 cells. Addition of high salt led to an increase in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and MCP-1 and had no effect on the release of IL-8. Mannitol, as an osmotic stress control, had no effect on the secretion of inflammatory mediators by arpe-19 cells. Co-culture of arpe-19 cells with high salt led to significant increases in the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, Akt, and NF-kB as well as an upregulation of the transcription factors NFAT5 and SGK1. High salt also increased IL-6 and MCP-1 production in arpe-19 cells. This effect is mediated by activation of the p38 MAPK, Akt, NF-kB, and NFAT5-SGK1 pathways.", "label": "dolly"}

{"text": "Background spotting in mammals can be caused by mutations in the genes for the endothelin B receptor and C-kit, whose protein products are necessary for proper migration, differentiation or survival of the melanoblast population of cells. Although many different dog breeds segregate this white spotting pattern, no genes have been identified that are linked to these phenotypes. Results:An intercross was generated from a female Newfoundland and a male border collie, and the white spotting phenotypes of the intercross progeny were evaluated by measuring the percentage surface area of white in the puppies. The border collie markings segregated as a simple autosomal recessive phenotype ( 7/25 intercross progeny had the phenotype). Two candidate genes, for the endothelin B receptor (Ednrb) and C-kit (Kit), were evaluated for segregation with the white spotting pattern. Polymorphisms between the border collie and Newfoundland were identified for Ednrb using southern analysis after a portion of the canine gene had been cloned. Polymorphisms for Kit were identified using a microsatellite developed from a bacterial artificial chromosome containing the canine gene. Conclusions:Both Ednrb and Kit were excluded as a cause of the white spotting pattern in at least two of the intercross progeny. Although these genes have been implicated in white spotting in other mammals, including horses, pigs, cows, mice and rats, they do not appear to be responsible for the white spotting pattern found in the border collie breed of dog.", "label": "dolly"}

This new approach allows one to recover certain classes of closed-form covariance functions with known non-stationary properties. The resulting class of non-stationary covariance functions is very general, flexible, and allows to retrieve known classes of closed-form covariance functions under some choice of the random weighting functions family. Under the framework of a single realization and local stationarity, we develop a method for parameter inference of these covariance functions, based on a local variogram estimator and a weighted local least-squares approach combined with kernel smoothing method.

{"text": "The screenplay was written by Eric Roth, who also won an Oscar for Forrest Gump. Leakey was former head of the Kenya Wildlife Service and played a key role in stemming the trade in illegal ivory. “I’ve felt a deep connection to Africa and its culture for much of my life,” Jolie said of Leakey. His extreme measures to tackle poachers, including using helicopter gunships in the national park, have helped the Kenyan elephant and rhino populations recover from the brink of disaster. He made international headlines in 1989, when he burned 12 tonnes of ivory in the park. Jolie said Africa is about a man drawn into the violent conflict with elephant poachers, who emerged with a deeper understanding of human footprint and a profound sense of responsibility for the world around him. Producer David Ellison described Leakey as “inspirational,” adding, “Africa is a story that deserves to be told.” Jolie’s next movie, Unbroken, starring Jack O’Connell, is due in cinemas later this year. She’s currently directing and starring with her husband Brad Pitt in By The Sea, based on her own screenplay.", "label": "dolly"}
{"text": "In the formation of a plant virus membrane, viral replication proteins and viral RNA must be associated with intracellular membranes to form replication factories. Many viruses encode membrane proteins that act as anchors for the replication complex and these hydrophobic proteins contain transmembrane domains and/or amphipathic helices that associate with the membrane and modify its structure. The comovirus co-pro and ntp-binding proteins, the cognate nepovirus x2 and ntp-binding proteins and the putative helicase ntb are among the best characterized plant virus integral membrane proteins and are functionally related to the picornavirus 2b, 2c and 3a membrane proteins. The identification of membrane association domains and analysis of the membrane topology of these proteins is discussed. The evidence suggesting that these proteins have the ability to induce membrane proliferation, alter the structure and integrity of intracellular membranes and modulate the induction of symptoms in infected plants is also reviewed. Finally, areas of research that need further investigation are highlighted.", "label": "dolly"}

We used periodontal health parameters like plaque index (pi), gingival index (gi), probing pocket depth (ppd), and clinical attachment loss (cal). We also collected information about diabetes history from the physician and recorded the latest values of glycosylated haemoglobin and existing diabetic complications. We then conducted a statistical analysis to evaluate the relationship between periodontal parameters and the degree of metabolic control, duration of disease, and appearance of complications. We found that periodontal disease was significantly more evident in patients diagnosed with diabetes and that the inflammation was greater in those who had a longer disease course, poor metabolic control, and diabetic complications.", "label": "dolly"}

But the Russian Olympic Committee and some athletes, including two-time Olympic pole vault champion Yelena Isinbayeva, have taken the matter to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas). The Olympics start on 5 August. Russia was suspended from global track and field events by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) in November 2015, following an independent report that showed a culture of widespread, state-sponsored doping. Its sports minister, Vitaly Mutko, admitted that his country's anti-doping systems had failed to catch doped athletes and apologised for that fact. He stopped short of admitting that Russia had been involved in state-sponsored doping, but his country will continue to be banned from the Rio Olympics if Cas upholds the IAAF's decision. Should Cas decide to uphold the IAAF's ban on Russia, the country's athletics federation could be allowed to compete in the Olympic Games with a handful of Russian athletes meeting a number of criteria. This includes repeatedly being tested outside their homeland. The IOC has been urged to ban the country from the Olympics and Paralympics, but said it would wait for the CAS ruling before announcing any sanction.", "label": "dolly"}

{"text": "Killer T cells are a type of T cell that play a vital role in killing cells that are infected with viruses, or are otherwise damaged or dysfunctional. Each type of T cell recognizes a specific antigen. When the T cell receptor (TCR) of an activated killer T cell binds to this specific antigen in complex with an MHC I molecule of another cell, it triggers the release of cytotoxins such as perforin and granulysin that can damage the plasma membrane of the target cell, allowing ions, water and other toxins to enter. The entry of these other toxins, in turn, triggers the target cell to undergo apoptosis. T cell killing of host cells is critical in preventing the replication of viruses. Killer T cell activation is tightly controlled and generally requires a very strong MHC/antigen activation signal, or other activation signals provided by \"helper\" T cells (see below).", "label": "dolly"}
{"text": "Based on previous spectral and temporal optical studies, Q2122-444 has been classified as a naked type 2 AGN, that is, an AGN that genuinely lacks a broad line region (blr). Its optical spectrum appeared to possess only narrow forbidden emission lines that are typical of type 2 AGNs, but the long-term optical light curve, obtained from a monitoring campaign over more than two decades, showed strong variability, apparently ruling out the presence of heavy obscuration. Here, we present the results from a Chandra observation of Q2122-444, carried out to shed light on the energetics of this enigmatic AGN. The X-ray analysis was complemented with simultaneous UV observations carried out by OM onboard XMM-Newton to assess the possible presence of a jet, and with new optical spectroscopic data from NTT/EFOSC2 to verify the actual absence of a blr. The higher-quality optical data revealed the presence of strong and broad Balmer lines that are at odds with the previous spectral classification of this AGN. The lack of detection of radio emission rules out the presence of a jet. The X-ray data combined with simultaneous UV observations carried out by OM onboard XMM-Newton confirm that Q2122-444 is a typical type-1 AGN without any significant intrinsic absorption. New estimates of the black hole mass independently obtained from the broad Balmer lines and from a new scaling technique based on X-ray spectral data suggest that Q2122-444 is accreting at a relatively high rate in Eddington units.", "label": "dolly"}

{"text": "Background: Poliomyelitis patients with scoliotic spine have limited data available to predict the course of intrathecal anaesthesia in the course of sub-arachnoid block. Thus, we intended to study the course of intrathecal anaesthesia in these patients in comparison to patients with normal spine using 0.5% bupivacaine (heavy).Methods: In this prospective observational study, 41 poliomyelitic patients scheduled for lower limb corrective surgeries under spinal anaesthesia were enrolled. Patients were divided into two groups (scoliotic spine group n=20, and normal spine group n=21) based on presence of scoliosis. All patients were injected 2 ml of 0.5% bupivacaine heavy intrathecally in the sitting position. The extent of block, bilateral spread, regression of sensory block and motor block were recorded. The demographic data were analysed using the unpaired t test or the chi square test as applicable.Block characteristics were analysed using the Mann-Whitney U test.Results: There was statistically significant difference in bilateral spread of sensory block in between the groups. However, there was no significant difference in the maximum extent of the sensory block and the time taken for two segment regression of sensory block. There was no significant difference in time taken to reach complete motor block and for complete recovery from motor block to its preoperative value.Conclusions: Bilateral symmetrical spread of local anaesthetics through intrathecal route can not be predicted accurately in poliomyelitis patients with scoliotic spine.

The paintings included self portraits of the former president and paintings of dogs; Bush's painting teacher subsequently revealed that he has painted hundreds of pieces. Bush is encouraged to paint after his wife, Laura, shows him examples of her doodles. Bush is also encouraged by Winston Churchill's book Painting as a Pastime and says he has been taking lessons once a week. \n                         Bush says he is pleased that the paintings are getting attention and believes that painting can be an outlet for creativity. He adds that he is surprised that his signature — a simple \"43,\" a reference to the order of his presidency — is more valuable than the painting.", "label": "dolly"}

{"text": "Insects use sound to communicate and detect prey or hosts. They have to localize the sound in most cases to perform adaptive behavioral responses. In the case of particle velocity receivers, such as the antennae of mosquitoes, directionality is not a problem because such receivers are inherently directional. Insects equipped with bilateral pairs of tympanate ears can make use of binaural cues for sound localization, like all other animals with two ears. Their small size, however, is a major problem to create sufficiently large binaural cues, as for interaural time differences and interaural intensity differences. For directional hearing, I will only briefly cover biophysical aspects. Instead, I will focus on aspects of directional hearing which received relatively little attention. These include the evolution of a pressure difference receiver, 3D hearing, directional hearing outdoors, and directional hearing for auditory scene analysis.", "label": "dolly"}

{"text": "Abstract Introduction: Atrial-esophageal fistula (AEF) is a rare severe disease, which may be associated with radiofrequency catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation (RFA-AF) or intraoperative radiofrequency ablation of atrial fibrillation (IRA-AF). Clinical findings: This report presents a 67-year-old man with AEF following RFA-AF, who was treated with esophageal stenting and surgical repair. Outcomes: He was attacked by out-of-control sepsis and infectious shock after surgery and died. Literature Review: AEF has been reported in the literature since 2003. Clinical manifestations usually include fever, rigor, sepsis, and neurologic symptoms. Chest CT and contrast enhanced CT may be the reliable noninvasive diagnosis methods due to their high sensitivity for AEF. Conclusion: Primary surgical repair should be made in time in order to save their lives. Conservative treatment or esophageal stenting alone may not be the better choice for AEF patients.", "label": "dolly"}

{"text": "We compared 33 hypertensive adults with comorbid type 2 diabetes mellitus (t2dm) and 29 normotensive adults, all of comparable age and educational level. Relative to normotensive participants, those with hypertension, in addition to higher prevalence of periventricular white matter (WM) lesions, had lower WM microstructural integrity of major fiber tracts as seen with MRI-based diffusion tensor imaging. Among participants with hypertension, those with t2dm had more widespread WM pathology than those without t2dm. Furthermore, consistent with previous research, both hypertension and t2dm were associated with decreased retinal arterial diameter. Further exploratory analysis demonstrated that the observed retinal arteriolar narrowing among individual with hypertension was associated with widespread subclinical losses in WM microstructural integrity and these associations were present predominantly in the frontal lobe. We found that t2dm adds to the damaging effects of hypertension on cerebral WM, and notably these effects were independent of age and body mass index. Given that the decrease in retinal arteriolar diameter may be a biomarker for parallel pathology in cerebral arterioles, our data suggest that the frontal lobe may be particularly vulnerable to microvascular damage in the presence of hypertension and t2dm.", "label": "dolly"}

The present study aimed to evaluate serum and production of inflammatory markers in adolescent Sardinian pcos. On the basis of homa findings, patients were divided into non-insulin resistant (nir) and insulin-resistant (ir), and were weight- and age-matched with healthy girls. Inflammatory cytokines (tnf-, il-6, il-10, tgf-), the reactant hs-crp, and in vitro inflammatory lymphocyte-monocyte response to microbial stimulus were evaluated. Healthy and pcos subjects showed significant correlations of leptin and hs-crp with BMI, whereas adiponectin was significantly reduced in all pcos groups. Moreover, in the latter group, lipopolysaccharide-activated monocytes secreted significantly higher levels of il-6 compared to nir and control subjects, showing elevated secretion levels of this cytokine. These results suggest that ir pcos patients have increased IL-6 serum levels and a higher secretion in LPS-activated monocytes, implying altered immune response in this pcos subtype. To conclude, in pcos patients, a low-grade inflammation is likely to occur due to altered immune response to inflammatory stimuli.", "label": "dolly"}

{"text": "We calculate the contribution to the cosmic x-ray background (cxb) of a population of power law spectrum sources with spectral indices distributed over a broad range of values. The composite spectrum of this source population is significantly harder than that given by the power law having the average value of spectral indices. Starting from spectral distributions which are approximately those observed from quasars, it is possible to reproduce the cxb spectrum from 0.1 keV to 1 keV. If the spectra of quasars steepen at around 100 keV, the resulting composite spectrum nearly perfectly fits the cxb in the even broader energy range, up to 2 keV. The qso population with broadly distributed spectral parameters is also characterized by a significant discrepancy between the results of hard and soft x-ray source counts. The same population of sources yields about three times more sources at 10 keV than at the corresponding flux at 1 keV, similarly to what is found from the comparison of HEAO-1 and Einstein/ROSAT measurements. Thus, by allowing the spectra of quasars to span a broad range of spectral indices, it is possible to reproduce both the cxb spectrum and account for the apparent differences in number counts in different energy bands.

Epidemiological studies on medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) have shown that neither a change in stage at diagnosis nor improvement in survival has occurred during the past 30 years. In patients with detectable serum calcitonin and no clinically apparent disease, a careful search for local recurrence and nodal or distant metastases should be performed. Conventional imaging modalities will not show any disease until calcitonin levels are at least 150 pg/ml. The objective of the study is to present the first experience with labelled glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue Lys40 (Ahx-Hynic-99MTC/Eda)-exendin-4 in the visualisation of MTC in humans. Material and method. Four patients aged 2274 years (two with sporadic and two with MEN2A-related MTC) were enrolled in the study. In all patients, GLP-1 receptor imaging was performed. Results. High-quality images were obtained in all patients. All previously known MTC lesions were confirmed in GLP-1 scintigraphy. Furthermore, one additional liver lesion was detected in a MTC male patient. Conclusions. GLP-1 receptor imaging with Lys40 (Ahx-Hynic-99MTC/Eda)-exendin-4 is able to detect MTC lesions. GLP-1 scintigraphy can serve as a confirmatory test in MTC patients, in whom other imaging procedures are inconsistent.", "label": "dolly"}

We exhibit a natural notion of \"simple one-form\", and identify a gravitational sector, a topological sector and a degenerate sector in the space of solutions to the simplicity constraints.  Classically, in the gravitational sector, the action is shown to be equivalent to that of three-dimensional first order Riemannian gravity.  This enables us to perform the complete spin foam quantization of the theory once the simplicity constraints are solved at the classical level, and to compare this result with the various models that have been proposed for the implementation of the constraints after quantization.  We observe that the bc prescription can not lead to the proper vertex amplitude.

{"text": "There is evidence suggesting that the same brain reward circuits that are involved in perpetuating drug abuse are implicated in the hedonic urges and food cravings observed clinically in overweight and obese individuals. A polymorphism of the D2 dopamine receptor, which renders it less sensitive to dopamine stimulation, has been proposed to promote self-stimulatory behavior, such as consuming alcohol, abusing drugs, or bingeing on foods. It is important to determine how this polymorphism may interact with other well-known candidate genes for obesity including polymorphisms of the leptin receptor gene and the OPRM1 gene. Leptin is a proinflammatory cytokine as well as a long-term signal maintaining body fat. Upper body obesity is associated with systemic inflammation due to the action of multiple cytokines, including leptin, throughout many organs, including the brain. The association of numerous diseases, including diabetes, heart disease, as well as depression, with chronic low-grade inflammation due to abdominal obesity has raised the possibility that obesity-associated inflammation affecting the brain may promote addictive behaviors leading to a self-perpetuating cycle.

{"text": "In solar euv spectra, the He resonance lines have unusually high intensities compared to other transition region lines. The formation of the helium resonance lines is studied through extensive non-lte radiative transfer calculations. The model atmospheres of Vernazza et al. (1981) are found to provide reasonable matches to the helium resonance line intensities, but significantly over-estimate the intensities of other transition region lines. New model atmospheres have been developed from emission measure distributions derived by Macpherson & Jordan (1999), which are consistent with observations of transition region lines other than those of helium. These models fail to reproduce the observed helium resonance line intensities by significant factors. The possibility that non-maxwellian electron distributions in the transition region might lead to increased collisional excitation rates in the helium lines is studied. Collisional excitation and ionization rates are re-computed for distributions with power law suprathermal tails which may form by the transport of fast electrons from high temperature regions. Enhancements of the helium resonance line intensities are found, but many of the predictions of the models regarding line ratios are inconsistent with observations. These results suggest that any such departures from maxwellian electron distributions are not responsible for the helium resonance line intensities.", "label": "dolly"}

We obtain the analytical expressions for all the correlations in terms of the relevant parameters of the problem and study the number of photons, entanglement, squeezing, and twin beams. Considering different regimes and configurations, we show the possibility to tune the instability thresholds as well as the quantumness of correlations by breaking the translational invariance of the system through a photonic crystal modulation.", "label": "dolly"}

{"text": "Immunity is a science that examines the structure and function of the immune system. It originated in medicine and early studies on the causes of immunity to disease. The earliest known reference to immunity was during the plague of Athens in 430 BC. Thucydides noted that people who had recovered from a previous bout of the disease could nurse the sick without contracting the illness a second time. In the 18th century, Pierre-Louis Moreau de Maupertuis made experiments with scorpion venom and observed that certain dogs and mice were immune to this venom. This and other observations of acquired immunity were later exploited by Louis Pasteur in his development of vaccination and his proposed germ theory of disease. Pasteur's theory was in direct opposition to contemporary theories of disease, such as the miasma theory. It was not until Robert Koch's 1891 proofs, for which he was awarded a Nobel Prize in 1905, that microorganisms were confirmed as the cause of infectious disease. Viruses were confirmed as human pathogens in 1901, with the discovery of the yellow fever virus by Walter Reed.", "label": "dolly"}

{"text": "We employ the nonequilibrium Green’s function approach to study time-dependent thermal transport in a linear chain system consisting of two semi-infinite leads connected together by a coupling that is modulated in time. The modulation is driven by an external agent that can absorb and emit energy. The amplitude of the modulated coupling is of the same order as the inter-particle coupling within each lead. When the leads have the same temperature, our numerical results show that modulating the coupling between the leads may direct energy to either flow into the leads simultaneously or flow out of the leads simultaneously, depending on the values of the driving frequency and temperature. A special combination of values of the driving frequency and temperature exists wherein no net energy flows into or out of the leads, even for long times. When one of the leads is warmer than the other, net energy flows out of the warmer lead. For the cooler lead, the direction of the energy current flow depends on the values of the driving frequency and temperature. In addition, we find transient effects to become more pronounced for higher values of the driving frequency.", "label": "dolly"}

While they all give the same result in the thermodynamic limit, major differences between them can occur for finite systems, in anomalous cases even for finite systems as large as a @xmath0. We resolve the situation by arguing that the chemical potential defined as the symbol conventionally appearing in the grand canonical density operator is the uniquely correct definition valid for all finite systems, the grand canonical ensemble being the only one of the various ensembles usually discussed ( microcanonical, canonical, gibbs, grand canonical) that is appropriate for statistical thermodynamics, whenever the chemical potential is physically relevant. The zero-temperature limit of this conventionally appearing chemical potential was derived by perdew et al. for finite systems involving electrons, generally allowing for electron-electron interactions; we extend this derivation and, for semiconductors, also consider the zero-temperature limit taken after the thermodynamic limit. The enormous finite size corrections (in macroscopic samples, e.g. @xmath0) for one rather common definition of the chemical potential, found recently by shegelski within the standard effective mass model of an ideal intrinsic semiconductor, are discussed.

Under the aegis of early government development aid, medical academics from West German universities became involved in several Asian, African and South American countries. The example selected for closer study is the support for the National Hygiene Institute in Togo, a former German colony and now a stout ally of the West. Positioned between public health and scientific research, between development aid and academia, between West German and West African interests, the project required multiple arrangements that are analyzed for their impact on the cooperation between the two countries. In a country like Togo, where higher education had been neglected under colonial rule, having qualified national staff became the decisive factor for the project. While routine services soon worked well, research required more sustained capacity building and did not lead to joint work on equal terms. In West Germany, the arrangement with the universities was a mutual benefit deal for government officials and medical academics. West German development aid did not have to create permanent jobs at home for the consulting experts it needed; it improved its chances to find sufficiently qualified German staff to work abroad and it profited from the academic renown of its consultants.

{"text": "This movie is definitely worth seeing. The director, Alain Chabat, has managed to capture the very essence of the Astérix comics and to create a fantastically modern and intelligent comedy, which is also an homage to the world of animated films. The laughs are so plentiful and so funny that it will take you two or three viewings to notice them all, between your bursts of laughter. The only downside is that a non-French audience (or at least a non-French-speaking audience) might not get all the jokes. There are so many conversations impossible to translate, so many situations directly related either to the comic books or to the French way of life, that the fun might be lessened. But it's still totally worth seeing for the beautiful visuals, the amazing stunts, the music, the totally crazy atmosphere and the excellent acting. All the actors are great, but the film would not be the same without Gérard Darmon and Jamel Debouze. And don't ever compare this magnificent movie to the terrible previous one by Claude Zidi and Alain Chabat.", "label": "dolly"}

More recently, tools borrowed from statistical physics of disordered systems and from computer science have provided a more complete characterization of their equilibrium behavior. However, the largest part of the results have been obtained in the thermodynamic limit which is often far from being reached when dealing with realistic instances of the problem. The numerical analysis presented here aims at comparing the outcomes given by the heuristic belief propagation algorithm with those given by exhaustive enumeration.

No significant changes in the organization of the programs were introduced since the previous Tau conference, that is why we will concentrate on some physics topics: (i) for Tauola Monte Carlo generator of lepton decays, simulation of five scalar final states based on the hadronic current has become available for the first time. As an example, simple but realistic current for final states like ee, eej, ej and ej has been presented. (ii) For the photos Monte Carlo, which generates radiative corrections in arbitrary decays, new results on next-to-leading order corrections became available for some decay modes. The complete corrections have been installed for leptonic decays into a pair of scalars.

We utilize our approach to investigate the variation of the isovector properties of those nuclei due to the symmetry energy and any limitations in their current values. Furthermore, our approach is beneficial in that it contains the Coulomb interaction in a self-consistent manner and that it is simple to separate the effect of the Coulomb interaction from the nucleon-nucleon interaction. As a result, we confirm the strong dependence of the symmetry energy on the various isovector properties of those nuclei.

{"text": "The rarity of hemangiopericytomas ( hpc ) and its controversial histological classification result in frequent misdiagnosis and thus make treatment quite challenging. It is often difficult to distinguish these tumors from meningiomas based on clinical features and radiological findings. This is a case report of a man, diagnosed clinically and radiologically as meningioma, which turned out to be anaplastic hpc on histological examination. A 30-year-old man presented with 3 months of progressively worsening headache and blurring of vision. Clinical examination revealed homonymous hemianopia with reduced visual acuity and papilledema bilaterally. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a multilobulated and heterogenous extraaxial lesion attached to the occipital falx. It measured 9.0 cm × 5.5 cm × 5.8 cm and expands bilaterally with major bulk on the left. An occipital craniotomy followed by a subtotal tumor excision was only achieved due to profuse bleeding intraoperatively. Histopathology confirmed an anaplastic hpc (WHO grade III). The importance of differentiation between hpcs and meningiomas cannot be overemphasized. A preoperative correct diagnosis is difficult, but it is important that it should be made. Multilobulated (mushroom appearance), prominent internal signal voids, relatively narrow dural attachment, and lytic destruction without calcifications are useful findings to distinguish hpcs from meningiomas.", "label": "dolly"}

Olive oil-based clinoleic and fish oil-based smoflipid profoundly inhibited leukocyte adhesion compared to lipofundin during lps-induced inflammation of the murine cremaster muscle. In the trauma model of cremaster muscle inflammation, lipofundin was the only lipid emulsion that even augmented leukocyte adhesion.

The necessity defense has sometimes been used as a shadow defense by civil disobedients to deny guilt without denouncing their politically motivated acts, and to present their political beliefs in the courtroom. However, court cases such as United States v. Schoon have greatly curtailed the availability of the political necessity defense.

Modeling a soft circular corral, we solve this equation under the potential, where is the distance to the center of the corral and is its radius. We expand the green’s function of electron surface states for a discrete sum of contributions from single poles at energies. The imaginary part is the half-width of the resonance produced by the soft confining potential, and turns out to be a simple increasing function of. In presence of an impurity, we solve the Anderson model at arbitrary temperatures using the resulting expression for the green’s function and perturbation theory up to second order in the Coulomb repulsion. We calculate the resulting change in the differential conductance as a function of voltage and space, in circular and elliptical corrals, for different conditions, including those corresponding to recent experiments.

{"text": "While Treaties and Regulations will have direct effect (if clear, unconditional and immediate), Directives do not generally give citizens (as opposed to the member state) standing to sue other citizens. In theory, this is because TFEU article 288 says Directives are addressed to the member states and leave the national authorities the choice of form and methods to implement them. This reflects that Directives often create minimum standards, leaving member states to apply higher standards. For example, the Working Time Directive requires that every worker has at least four weeks paid holidays each year, but most member states require more than 28 days in national law. However, on the current position adopted by the Court of Justice, citizens have standing to make claims based on national laws that implement Directives, but not from Directives themselves. Directives do not have so called 'horizontal' direct effect (i.e. between non-state parties). This view was instantaneously controversial, and three Advocate Generals persuasively argued that Directives should create rights and duties for all citizens. However, the Court of Justice refused, and in the early 1990s three Advocate Generals concluded that Directives should have horizontal effect.

This paper presents a time-dependent extension of the generator coordinate method which can be used to improve existing approximations to the exchange-correlation (xc) potential in time-dependent density-functional theory (tddft). As an example, the time-dependent generator coordinates are used to build memory effects into any existing adiabatic xc potential, allowing for a more accurate description of driven parametric oscillations of two interacting electrons in a harmonic potential.

We propose a new preconditioner that can treat insulating and metallic systems in a unified way. The new preconditioner, which we call an elliptic preconditioner, is constructed by solving an elliptic partial differential equation. The elliptic preconditioner is shown to be more effective in accelerating the convergence of a fixed point iteration than the existing approaches for large inhomogeneous systems at low temperature.

{"text": "In the inflaton perturbations it is shown that the evolution of the difference between the spectral indices can be translated into information on the scale dependence of the tensor to scalar amplitudes ratio, $\\eta_{T}\\neq \\eta_S$, and how the scalar field potential can be derived from that information. Examples are given where $\\eta_{T}$ converges to a constant value during inflation but the dynamics are rather different from the power law model. Cases are presented where $\\eta_{T}$ is not characteristic of the inflationary dynamics but the resulting perturbation spectra are consistent with the CMB and LSS data. The inflaton potential corresponding to $\\eta_{T}$ given by a nth order polynomial of the e-folds number is derived in quadratures expressions. Since the observable difference between the spectral indices evaluated at a pivot scale yields information about the linear term of that polynomial, the first order case is explicitly written down. The solutions show features beyond the exponential form corresponding to power law inflation and can be matched with current observational data.", "label": "dolly"}

{"text": "Protein clearance is critical for maintaining the integrity of neuronal cells, and there is accumulating evidence that in most neurodegenerative disorders, impaired protein clearance fundamentally contributes to functional and structural alterations, eventually leading to clinical symptoms. Dysfunction of protein clearance leads to intra- and extraneuronal accumulation of misfolded proteins and aggregates. The pathological hallmark of Lewy body disorders (LBDS) is the abnormal accumulation of misfolded proteins such as alpha-synuclein and amyloid-beta in a specific subset of neurons, which in turn has been related to deficits in protein clearance. In this paper, we will highlight common intraneuronal (including autophagy and unfolded protein stress response) and extraneuronal (including interaction of neurons with astrocytes and microglia, phagocytic clearance, autoimmune response, cerebrospinal fluid transport, and transport across the blood-brain barrier) protein clearance mechanisms, which may be altered across the spectrum of LBDS. A better understanding of the pathways underlying protein clearance in particular of alpha-synuclein and amyloid-beta in LBDS may result in the identification of novel biomarkers for disease onset and progression, and of new therapeutic targets.", "label": "dolly"}

However, many fundamental algorithms in computational geometry rely on coordinate representations, including the straightforward algorithms for finding a halving line and finding a point on the convex hull, both in linear time. In his book, “Axioms and Hulls,” Knuth asks whether these problems can be solved in linear time in a more abstract setting, given only the orientation of each triple of points, i.e., the sets of points that are realizable in the Euclidean plane. We answer this question affirmatively and give a proof for sets realizable in the Euclidean plane and then extend the result to non-realizable abstract order types. First, we give a proof for finding a halving line through any given point, as well as the vertices of the convex hull edges that are intersected by the supporting line of any two given points of the set in linear time.

{"text": "In 2009, a lawsuit was filed challenging a transaction of a parcel of land from unknown to unknown. Carroll had his lawyer draw up a deed conveying the land to himself and his wife. On November 19, 1986, the deed was recorded in the land records of Little Compton, Rhode Island. The couple planned to subdivide the land for sale and built boundary markers to demarcate the property. The following spring, they cleared brush and trimmed trees, while a surveyor placed six granite markers and metal rods in the middle of the path to help mark where the subdivision property lines met. The Carrolls applied for subdivision approval, which was granted with certain conditions, including the need to widen Amy Hart Path. The engineer was hired to build a retaining wall and install drainage pipes in the middle of the path. Drainage pipes were also installed on the property. Francis Carroll passed away in 1989. The court ruled in Karen Carroll's favor in 1995 and declared Amy Hart Path a public road, allowing the Carrolls to bring utilities to the property and install utility poles. Adverse possession laws were enacted in 1896, setting forth the necessary requirements to claim the land. In Rhode Island, the state requires that an individual claiming adverse possession be an honest and reasonable person and not act in bad faith. After winning the lawsuit in 1995, Karen Carroll successfully pursued the road and successfully sued to have the property declared a public road. Christian LeBlanc cleared and improved the land, built a driveway, and set up security deposits for purchase and sales agreements. The buyer, LeBlanc, was able to secure permits to lay utility lines and build the retaining wall. The judge found that the deed tracing the history of adverse possession laws was in clear and unambiguous. In 1996, adverse possession laws were enacted in Rhode Island, setting forth the legal requirements for establishing and acquiring property.

{"text": "The goal of the study was to review our experience with single - incision laparoscopic surgery (sils) and to compare costs and operative time to standard laparoscopic surgery (sls). A prospectively collected database of operative times and costs was analyzed for the years 2008 to 2011. Sils cases were compared to standard laparoscopy on a procedure-matched basis. Patient demographics, on-table time and consumable costs were collated. Descriptive statistics and Mann-Whitney U tests were utilized with SPSS for Windows. Analysis of the data demonstrate that neither consumable costs nor operative time were significantly different in each group. Comparing operative costs, sils appendicectomy, nephrectomy/heminephrectomy, and ovarian cystectomy/oophorectomy showed cost benefit over sls (397 vs. 467; 942 vs. 1127; 394 vs. 495). A trend towards higher cost for sils palomo procedure is noted (734 vs. 400). Operative time for sils appendicectomy, nephrectomy/heminephrectomy, and palomo was lower compared to sls (60 vs. 103 minutes, 130 vs. 60 minutes, and 60 vs. 80 minutes).

{"text": "Our research group is interested in the stability of standing shock waves in advection-dominated accretion flows into a Schwarzschild black hole. We performed a 2-dimensional general relativistic hydrodynamic simulation and compared our results with a linear analysis in the equatorial plane. We demonstrated that the accretion shock is stable against axisymmetric perturbations but becomes unstable to non-axisymmetric perturbations. The results of our simulations are consistent with our linear analysis. By analyzing the dynamical simulations, we found that the instability is likely to be of the Papaloizou-Pringle type, induced by the repeated propagation of acoustic waves. The comparison of different wave-travel times with the growth timescale of the instability suggests that the instability is likely to be of the papaloizou-pringle type, induced by the repeated propagation of acoustic waves. However, the wavelengths of perturbations are too long to clearly define the reflection point. We further analyzed the non-linear phase in the dynamical simulations and found that quadratic mode couplings precede the non-linear saturation. It is also found that not only short-term random fluctuations by turbulent motions but also quasi periodic oscillations take place on longer time scales in the non-linear phase. We give some possible implications of the instability for quasi-periodic oscillations and the central engine of gamma ray bursts.", "label": "dolly"}

This scheme can be used to cascade and scale up for efficient information distribution in an optical network.

In order to further investigate the nature of these infrared sources, warm  imaging is needed, which may help resolve galaxies from the white dwarfs and provide more accurate flux measurements.", "label": "dolly"}

{"text": "Over the course of its motion through the galaxy, our solar system has encountered many interstellar environments of varying characteristics. Interplanetary medium (ism) density variations spanning seven orders of magnitude are commonly seen throughout the general galactic environment, and a sufficiently dense cloud within this range has the potential to dramatically alter the structure of the heliosphere. We present observations of the ism environments the sun has most recently encountered based on high-resolution optical spectra toward nearby stars in the direction of the historical solar trajectory. The data were obtained with the highest-resolution spectrographs available, including the Tull spectrograph on the Harlan J. Smith telescope at McDonald Observatory and the Ultra-high-resolution Facility on the Anglo-Australian Telescope at the Anglo-Australian Observatory. Observations were made of interstellar and doublet absorption toward 43 bright stars within 120 pc. No absorption is seen out to a distance of 120 pc, but a complex collection of absorbers is seen in stars beyond 120 pc. While common absorbers are consistently seen in most sight lines, significant spatial variation is also detected, even between closely spaced sight lines. This pervasive evidence of small-scale structure not only speaks to the complexity of the morphology or physical properties of the gas in the ism, but also emphasizes that dramatic structural changes to the heliosphere are common and it is important to understand the implications of such changes, such as the modulation in the cosmic ray flux, on planets.", "label": "dolly"}

The minimum energy was determined by the gradient method and the equilibrium magnetization directions found were used to calculate magnetoresistance curves. By choosing spacers with a thickness such that biquadratic coupling is stronger than bilinear coupling, unusual behaviors for the magnetoresistance were observed: i) for the 110 case there is a different behavior for structures based on even and odd Fibonacci generations; and ii) for the 100 case we found magnetic field ranges for which the magnetoresistance increases with magnetic field.", "label": "dolly"}
{"text": "We present the results of a numerical adaptive mesh refinement hydrodynamical and n - body simulation in a cosmology. We focus on the analysis of the main properties of massive galaxies (according to Hubble types). For all the massive virtual galaxies, we carry out a careful study of their one dimensional density, luminosity, velocity dispersion and stellar population profiles. In order to best compare with observational data, the method to estimate the velocity dispersion is calibrated by using an approach similar to that performed in the observations, based on the stellar populations of the simulated galaxies. With these ingredients, we discuss the different properties of massive galaxies in our sample according to their morphological types, accretion histories and dynamical properties. We find that the galaxy merging history is the leading actor in shaping the massive galaxies that we see nowadays. Indeed, galaxies having experienced a turbulent life are the most massive in the sample and show the steepest metallicity gradients. Besides the importance of merging, only a small fraction of the final stellar mass has been formed ex - situ (10-50%) while the majority of the stars formed within the galaxy. These accreted stars are significantly older and less metallic than the stars formed in - situ and tend to occupy the most external regions of the galaxies.", "label": "dolly"}

The concentration of s-nodes changes abruptly at given value of the probability. This explains why for small values of the rewiring probability, clusterization is more prevalent in the Watts-Strogatz network.

{"text": "The organization of interactions in complex systems can be represented by networks connecting different units. These graphs are useful for describing the local and global complexity of the underlying systems. The origin of their topological structure can be diverse, resulting from various mechanisms such as multiplicative processes and optimization. In spatial networks or in graphs where cost constraints are at work, optimization plays a key part in shaping their organization. In this paper we study network designs resulting from a Pareto optimization process, where different simultaneous constraints are targets of selection. We analyze three variations on a problem finding phase transition. Distinct phases are associated to different arrangements of the connections, but the need of drastic topological changes does not dictate the presence, nor the nature of the phase transitions that arise. Instead, the functions under optimization do play a determinant role. This reinforces the view that phase transitions do not arise from intrinsic properties of a system alone, but from the interplay of that system with its external constraints.", "label": "dolly"}

{"text": "Rhabdomyosarcomas (rms) in children and adolescents are defined by skeletal muscle features and the presence or absence of the pax3/7-foxo1 fusion gene. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNA molecules that regulate gene expression in a cell-specific manner. Sequencing analyses of miRNAs in 64 rms revealed expression patterns of miRNAs separating skeletal muscle, fusion gene positive and negative rms. Integration with parallel gene expression data assigned biological functions to 12 co-expression networks/modules that are myogenic in nature. Modules were correlated with clinical outcome and fusion status, with miRNAs controlling cell migration regulated by the fusion protein. Regulation of miRNAs by the fusion protein was demonstrated after reduction of pax3-foxo1 and exemplified by miR-9-5p. Mir-9-5p levels correlated with poor outcome in fusion gene positive rms, even within fusion gene positive rms. Mir-9-5p reduction inhibited rms cell migration. Our findings reveal a role of miRNAs in a regulatory framework of biological and clinical significance in rms.", "label": "dolly"}

{"text": "The introduction of smart electricity meters with cellular radio interface puts an additional load on the wireless cellular networks.  Currently, these meters are designed for low duty cycle billing and occasional system checks, generating a low-rate sporadic traffic. As the number of distributed energy resources increases, the household power will become more variable and unpredictable from the viewpoint of the distribution system operator (DSO). It is therefore expected, in the near future, to have an increased number of wide area measurement systems (WAMS) devices with phasor measurement unit (PMU)-like capabilities in the distribution grid, allowing the utilities to monitor the low voltage grid quality while providing information required for tighter grid control. From a communication standpoint, the traffic profile will change drastically towards higher data volumes and higher rates per device. In this paper, we characterize the current traffic generated by smart electricity meters and supplement it with the potential traffic requirements brought by introducing enhanced smart meters, i.e. meters with PMU-like capabilities. Our study shows how GSM/GPRS and LTE cellular system performance behaves with the current and next generation smart meters traffic, where it is clearly seen that the PMU data will seriously challenge these wireless systems. We conclude by highlighting the possible solutions for upgrading the cellular standards, in order to cope with the upcoming smart metering traffic.", "label": "dolly"}

{"text": "Rewrite the following paragraph in a different style using your own words.\n\n                        Multiple inheritance in PHP is more limited than it is in other languages, due to the Object-oriented nature of the language. To overcome this, PHP 5.4 introduced traits to help out with these scenarios. Traits give us the ability to add to another class' functionality, which makes them great for extensibility and reusability. \n                        What you can also do is decorate it with another class that implements the same interface, add your functionality to it and then delegate back to the original one. Here is a very simple example:\nclass NotifiedAction implements ActionInterface { private $action; public function __construct(ActionInterface $action) { $this->action = $action; } public function notifyUser() { // Logic for user notification } public function trigger() { $performed = $this->action->trigger(); $this->notifyUser(); return $performed; } }\n                        As you can see, we now have a NotifiedAction class that implements the same interface and that takes the same interface as a constructor parameter. This acts like a decorator around the parameter object because it wraps around it and adds to its functionality from the outside (in this case sends a notification after the action is performed).\n                        The reason why the decorator must implement the same interface is to make sure it has the same public API as the decorated one. In other words, the objects need to be more or less interchangeable. This is actually the main drawback of the decorator pattern, as wrapping interfaces with multiple methods can become quite clunky. But let's get back to our example.\n                        Now you have 2 options for triggering actions with the ActionInterface :\n                        $action = new Action(); $action->trigger();", "label": "dolly"}

We selected, analysed and characterized a sample of 67 @xmath1dor stars for which we have * Kepler* observations available. For all the targets in the sample, we assembled high-resolution spectroscopy to confirm their F-type nature. We found fourteen binaries, among which four single-lined binaries, five double-lined binaries, two triple systems and three binaries with no detected radial velocity variations. We estimated the orbital parameters whenever possible. For the single stars and the single-lined binaries, fundamental parameter values were determined from spectroscopy. We searched for period spacing patterns in the photometric data and identified this diagnostic for 50 of the stars in the sample, 46 of which are single stars or single-lined binaries. We found a strong correlation between the spectroscopic and the period spacing values, confirming the influence of rotation on @xmath1dor-type pulsations as predicted by theory. We also found relations between the dominant g-mode frequency, the longest pulsation period detected in series of prograde modes, @xmath2, and @xmath3.

{"text": "The large - scale extragalactic jets, observed to extend from a few to a few hundred kiloparsecs from active galactic nuclei, are now studied over many decades in frequency of electromagnetic spectrum, from radio until possibly ( possibly ) tev rays.  For hundreds of known radio jets, only about 30 are observed at optical frequencies.  Most of them are relatively short and faint, with only a few exceptions, like 3C 273 or M 87, allowing for detailed spectroscopic and morphological studies.  Somewhat surprisingly, the large - scale jets can be very prominent in x-rays.  To date, about 30 jets have been detected within the keV range, although the nature of this emission is still under debate.  In general, both optical and x-ray jet observations present serious problems for standard radiation models for the considered objects.  Recent tev observations of M 87 suggest the possibility of generating large photon fluxes at these high energies by its extended jet.  In this paper, we summarize information about multiwavelength emission of the large - scale jets, and we point out several modifications of the standard jet radiation models (connected with relativistic bulk velocities, jet radial stratification and particle energization all the way along the jet) which can possibly explain some of the mentioned puzzling observations.  We also comment on x-ray emission of the discussed objects.", "label": "dolly"}

In dentistry, co-cr alloys are commonly used for the fabrication of metallic frameworks of removable partial dentures, and recently have been used as metallic substructures for the fabrication of porcelain-fused-to-metal restorations and implant frameworks. The increased worldwide interest in utilizing co-cr alloys for dental applications is related to their low cost and adequate physical-mechanical properties. Additionally, among base-metal alloys, co-cr alloys are used more frequently in many countries to replace nickel-chromium (ni-cr) alloys. This is mainly due to the increased concern regarding the toxic effects of ni on the human body when alloys containing ni are exposed to the oral cavity.

The latitudinal dependence of SW and the actual flow direction of the interstellar gas with respect to the sun are also taken into account in the model.

{"text": "We propose a simple method for incorporating correlations into the impact parameter space description of multiple (semi-)hard partonic collisions in high energy hadron-hadron scattering. The perturbative QCD input is the standard factorization theorem for inclusive dijet production with a lower cutoff on transverse momentum. The width of the transverse distribution of hard partons is fixed by parameterizations of the two-gluon form factor. We then reconstruct the hard contribution to the total inelastic profile function and obtain corrections due to correlations to the more commonly used eikonal description. Estimates of the size of double correlation corrections are based on the rate of double collisions measured at the Tevatron. We find that, if typical values for the lower transverse momentum cutoff are used in the calculation of the inclusive hard dijet cross section, then the correlation corrections are necessary for maintaining consistency with expectations for the total inelastic proton-proton cross section at the LHC.", "label": "dolly"}

Tory was able to trace the pigeon's original owner in Hertfordshire, who had sent a courier to collect the bird. Tory said: \"We suddenly heard a flapping sound in the water and saw this pigeon desperately trying to crawl up the side of the rocks.\" Tory jumped into the water to rescue the pigeon which was \"completely sodden\" and \"distressed\" with a cut to its neck. Tory used the pigeon's identification number to trace the bird's owners, Ray and Brendan from Baldock, near Stevenage in Hertfordshire. Brendan Eccles said the pigeon was released in a race from Blandford, Dorset, on 01 August and should have been home \"in a few hours\". He said the four-month-old pigeon could have become disoriented and headed in the wrong direction. Racing pigeon enthusiast Terry Luscombe, from Plymouth, looked after the bird for three weeks and \"got him back to fitness\" before releasing him on Monday to return to Hertfordshire. Mr Luscombe said it appeared from the cut to the pigeon's neck he had been the victim of a second hawk attack that resulted in him landing in the water.", "label": "dolly"}

The modulation of planetary radio emissions can be explained by the electron-cyclotron maser instability and used to detect exomoons around giant planets in exoplanetary systems. Extrapolating from a model in the Jupiter - Io system, criteria for exomoon detection can be defined.

The main goal is to investigate the response of the detector to hadrons, specifically pions and kaons, interacting with the target nuclei. The simulated detector response is presented through a series of Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. The MC results show that the response of the detector to hadrons of different energies follows a vavilov distribution, as compared to a gaussian distribution at high energies. We also present the calibration of hadron energy as a function of the hit multiplicity and the energy resolution of the hadrons as a function of their energy. These two parameters are discussed in detail. Overall, the hadron energy response of the detector has been presented in detail, as well as its calibration and the hadron energy resolution.", "label": "dolly"}

{"text": "The role of disorder in the field of three-dimensional time-reversal-invariant topological insulators has become an active field of research recently. Nevertheless, the computation of topological invariants for large, disordered systems still poses a considerable challenge. In this paper, we apply and extend a recently proposed method based on the scattering matrix approach, which allows the study of large systems at reasonable computational effort with few-channel leads. By computing the topological invariant directly for disordered topological anderson insulators, we unambiguously identify the topological nature of this phase without resorting to its connection with the clean case. We are able to efficiently compute the topological phase diagram in the mass-disorder plane. The topological phase boundaries are found to be well described by the self-consistent Born approximation, both for vanishing and finite chemical potential. Our method can be applied to arbitrary three-dimensional topological insulators.", "label": "dolly"}

The aslamazov-larkin result is recovered as a limiting situation. Our method is numerically stable and the nonlinear term is easily included. We attempt a comparison between our numerical results and the available experimental data.

The Normans are noted for both their culture, such as their unique Romanesque architecture and musical traditions, and for their significant military accomplishments and innovations. Norman adventurers founded the Kingdom of Sicily under Roger II after conquering southern Italy on the Saracens and Byzantines, and an expedition on behalf of their duke, William the Conqueror, led to the Norman conquest of England at the Battle of Hastings in 1066.

{"text": "We consider the dynamical atom-wall Casimir-Polder force in the non-equilibrium configuration of an atom near a perfectly conducting wall, initially prepared in an excited state with the field in its vacuum state. We evaluate the time-dependent Casimir-Polder force on the atom and find that it exhibits an oscillatory behavior from attractive to repulsive both in time and in space. We also investigate the asymptotic behavior in time of the dynamical force and of related local field quantities, showing that the static value of the force, as obtained by a time-independent approach, is recovered for times much larger than the timescale of the atomic self-dressing, but smaller than the atomic decay time. We also discuss the evolution of global quantities such as atomic and field energies, and their asymptotic behavior. We show that new relevant features are obtained in the case of an initially excited atom, for example much larger values of the dynamical force with respect to the static one, allowing for an easier way to single-out and observe the dynamical Casimir-Polder effect. We compare our results for the dynamical force on the excited atom with analogous results recently obtained for an initially bare ground-state atom, showing that new relevant features are obtained in the case of an initially excited atom, for example much larger values of the dynamical force with respect to the static one.

In contrast, our approach uses continuous variables and highly efficient homodyne measurements. We present a two-qubit scheme, with a simple bucket measurement system yielding an entangling operation with probability 1/2. Then we extend this to a three-qubit interaction, increasing this probability to 3/4. We discuss the important issues of the overhead cost and the time scaling.

Furthermore, the cosmological constant is not renormalized. Thus, the quantum theory is distinct from a quantization of standard Einstein gravity. Here we show that, within a truncation of the full renormalization group flow of unimodular quantum gravity, there is a non-trivial ultraviolet attractive fixed point, yielding a UV completion for unimodular gravity. We discuss important differences to the standard asymptotic safety scenario for gravity, and provide further evidence for this scenario by investigating a new form of the gauge-fixing and ghost sector.", "label": "dolly"}

The individual is the ultimate judge of right and wrong. More than this, since only individuals act, only individuals can act unjustly. When the government knocks on the door, it is an individual in the form of a postman or tax collector whose hand hits the wood. Before Thoreau's imprisonment, when a confused taxman had wondered aloud about how to handle his refusal to pay, Thoreau had advised, \"Resign.\" If a man chose to be an agent of injustice, then Thoreau insisted on confronting him with the fact that he was making a choice. But if government is \"the voice of the people\", as it is often called, shouldn't that voice be heeded? Thoreau admits that government may express the will of the majority but it may also express nothing more than the will of elite politicians. Even a good form of government is \"liable to be abused and perverted before the people can act through it\". Moreover, even if a government did express the voice of the people, this fact would not compel the obedience of individuals who disagree with what is being said.

{"text": "Infrared ( ir ) light is vital for short-range wireless communication, thermal sensing, spectroscopy, material processing, medical surgery, astronomy, and more. However, it is much more difficult to transport than optical light or microwave radiation. Existing hollow-core infrared (ir) waveguides typically use a layer of metallic coating on the inner wall of the waveguide. Such a metallic layer, though reflective, still absorbs guided light significantly due to its finite ohmic loss, especially for transverse-magnetic ( tm ) light. In this paper, we show that metal wire based metamaterials may serve as an efficient tm reflector, reducing propagation loss of the tm mode by two orders of magnitude. By further imposing a conventional metal cladding layer, which reflects specifically transverse-electric ( te ) light, we can potentially obtain a low-loss hollow-core fiber. Simulations confirm that loss values for several low-order modes are comparable to the best results reported so far.", "label": "dolly"}

{"text": "Collective atomic vibrations ( phonons ) in solids are more effective at transporting heat than photons. This is why the conduction mode of heat transport ( mediated by phonons ) is dominant compared to the radiation mode ( mediated by photons ) in non-metals ( mediated by phonons can not traverse a vacuum gap ). However, since phonons are unable to traverse a vacuum gap, it is commonly believed that two bodies separated by a gap can not exchange heat via phonons. Recently, a mechanism was proposed by Citex which explains how phonons can transmit heat across a vacuum gap. This heat transfer mechanism is relevant for heating and cooling nanostructures; the heating of flying heads in magnetic storage disks is an example. In this work, the theoretical derivation for modeling phonon transmission is revisited and extended to the case of two bodies made of different materials separated by a vacuum gap. Magnitudes of phonon transmission and hence heat transfer, for commonly used materials in the micro and nano-electromechanical industry are calculated and compared with the calculation of conduction heat transfer through air for small gaps.", "label": "dolly"}
{"text": "Trioxygen (O 3) is known as ozone and is a very reactive allotrope of oxygen that is damaging to lung tissue. Ozone is produced in the upper atmosphere when O 2 combines with atomic oxygen made by the splitting of O 2 by ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Since ozone absorbs strongly in the UV region of the spectrum, the ozone layer of the upper atmosphere functions as a protective radiation shield for the planet. Near the Earth's surface, it is a pollutant formed as a by-product of automobile exhaust. The metastable molecule tetraoxygen (O 4) was discovered in 2001, and was assumed to exist in one of the six phases of solid oxygen. It was proven in 2006 that this phase, created by pressurizing O 2 to 20 GPa, is in fact a rhombohedral O 8 cluster. This cluster has the potential to be a much more powerful oxidizer than either O 2 or O 3 and may therefore be used in rocket fuel.

{"text": "Constant temperature molecular dynamics simulations were used to study solutions of flexible polyelectrolyte chains at nonzero concentrations with explicit counterions and unscreened coulombic interactions. Counterion condensation, measured via the self-diffusion coefficient of the counterions, is found to increase with polymer concentration, but contrary to the prediction of Manning's theory, the renormalized charge fraction on the chains decreases with increasing Bjerrum length, without showing any saturation. Scaling analysis of the radius of gyration shows that the chains are extended at low polymer concentrations and small Bjerrum lengths, while at sufficiently large Bjerrum lengths, the chains shrink to produce compact structures with exponents smaller than a Gaussian chain, suggesting the presence of attractive intrachain interactions. A careful study of the radial distribution function of the center-of-mass of the polyelectrolyte chains shows clear evidence that effective interchain attractive interactions also exist in solutions of flexible polyelectrolytes, similar to what has been found for rodlike polyelectrolytes. Our results suggest that the broad maximum observed in scattering experiments is due to clustering of chains.", "label": "dolly"}

The people who occupied cmc, the Loma San Gabriel, lived throughout much of present-day Durango and Zacatecas in Mexico. Their known pathoecology puts them into risk categories for the transmission of T. gondii and T. cruzi. Human antibodies created in response to these parasites can be detected in modern saliva using elisa kits intended for use with human serum. For these reasons, quids were reconstituted and subjected to elisa testing. All test wells yielded negative results. These results could be a factor of improper methods because there is no precedence for this work in the existing literature. The results could equally be a simple matter of parasite absence among those people who occupied cmc. A final consideration is the taphonomy of human antibodies and whether or not elisa is a sufficient method for recovering antibodies from archaeological contexts. An additional elisa test targeting secretory IgA (siga) was conducted to further examine the failure to detect parasite-induced antibodies from quids.

Even for protostars with similar final masses, the accretion histories can differ significantly. High-mass stars are concentrated in the central parts of dense cluster-forming cloud regions and begin to form early on during the turbulent fragmentation process of the cloud.

{"text": "We propose a mechanism for the origin of the galactic ridge x - ray background that naturally explains the properties of the Fe K line, specifically the detection of the centroid line energy below 6.7 kev and the apparent broadness of the line. Motivated by recent evidence of nonthermal components in the spectrum of the galactic x-ray background, we consider a model that is a mixture of thermal plasma components of possibly supernova origin and nonthermal emission from the interaction of low energy cosmic ray electrons (lecre) with the interstellar medium. The lecre may be accelerated in supernova explosions or by ambient interstellar plasma turbulence. Atomic collisions of fast electrons produce characteristic nonthermal, narrow x-ray emission lines that can explain the complex galactic background spectrum. Using the ASCA GIS archival data from the Scutum arm region, we show that a two-temperature thermal plasma model with temperatures of @xmath1 and @xmath2 keV, plus a lecre component models the data satisfactorily. Our analysis rules out a purely nonthermal origin for the emission. It also rules out a significant contribution from low energy cosmic ray ions because their nonthermal x-ray production would be accompanied by a nuclear line diffuse emission exceeding the upper limits obtained using OSSE and by an excessive galaxy-wide Be production rate. The proposed model naturally explains the observed complex line features and removes the difficulties associated with previous interpretations of the data which evoked a very hot thermal component (of 3 keV) and a low-energy cosmic-ray ion component, which is not required to explain the complex line features.

Five teams are engaged on a scavenger hunt and battle each other and their wits to win the all night contest - just for the sheer joy of knowing yours is the best team. Notable for several screen debuts including David Naughton's first film role after his Dr. Pepper commercials and before his major 1981 hit American Werewolf in London. Also features Paul Ruebens in what I believe is his first Pee Wee Herman-esque roll a year before he became known for it. And last but not least, Michael J. Fox gets his first film role here. Fans will remember Stephen Furst as Flounder in Animal House. Outside of that, no names, but all funny characters. Doubt it has ever made it to DVD, but there are still probably some VHS copies floating around and you might even catch on a late, late show sometime. If you do, it is worth your watch.

{"text": "This is just one more of those appalling films that you find on Lifetime TV which portray the abhorrent behavior of some disgusting woman in an empathetic manner. Along with other such nasty films as \"The Burning Bed,\" \"Enough,\" and \"Monster,\" this film takes a disgusting criminal and attempts to show the viewer why she's not such a bad person after all. Give us a break! Here's my question to the filmmakers: If LeTourneau were a man, and Vili were a 12 year old girl, would you have made a picture sympathizing and empathizing with this person? Answer: Hell no. Imagine switching the genders in this film, and then you'll see just why myself and others here consider this a worthless piece of garbage. Were the genders swapped, there would be no attempt to empathize with the criminal. Instead, we'd likely be treated to a portrayal of a monstrous and hideous man preying upon a young girl, his lascivious behavior landing him in prison, and his brainwashed victim suffering from Stockholm Syndrome. The only reason LeTourneau does not receive the same treatment in this film is by virtue of her sex. Let's call a spade a spade. LeTourneau is a pedophile. Plain and simple. No ifs, ands or buts. She's a criminal who belongs in prison, and deserves our derision and contempt, but certainly not our pity or empathy.", "label": "dolly"}

{"text": "The molecular mechanisms and signalling cascades that trigger long-term depression (ltd) in the gi metabotropic glutamate receptor (mgluR) have been the subject of intensive investigation for nearly two decades. The generation of genetically modified animals has played a crucial role in elucidating the involvement of key molecules regulating the induction and maintenance of gi-ltd. We will discuss the requirement of the newly discovered mapkapk-2 (mk2) and mapkapk-3 (mk3) signalling cascade in regulating gi-ltd. Recently, it has been shown that the absence of mk2 impaired the induction of gi-ltd, an effect that is caused by reduced internalization of ampa receptors. As the mk2 cascade directly regulates tumour necrosis factor alpha (tnf) production, this review will examine the evidence that the release of tnf acts to regulate glutamate receptor expression and therefore may play a functional role in the impairment of gi-ltd and the cognitive deficits observed in mk2/3 double knockout animals. The strong links of increased tnf production in both aging and neurodegenerative disease could implicate the action of mk2 in these processes. The gi-ltd-mediated impairment of learning and memory may therefore be mediated by tnf levels that are enhanced in the absence of mk2.", "label": "dolly"}

{"text": "In a purely capitalist mode of production, professional and labor organizations cannot limit the number of workers, nor are workers' wages controlled by the employer but rather by the market. Wages are the same as prices for any other good, and thus the gap between the wage and the price of labor is driven by the race between the demand for the skilled worker and the supply of the skilled worker. Therefore, inequality is driven by this price. \n                             On the other hand, markets can also concentrate wealth, pass environmental costs on to society, and abuse workers and consumers. Additionally, markets, by themselves, even when they are stable, can often lead to high levels of inequality, outcomes that are widely viewed as unfair. Employers who offer a below market wage will find that their businesses are chronically understaffed, resulting in a competitive disadvantage.

{"text": "The temperature of the intergalactic medium (igm) can provide a powerful constraint on the reionisation history. However, the temperature has been measured to a redshift of @xmath0. Additionally, the measured temperature is limited due to the redshift restriction of @xmath1. We use recent temperature measurements of the near-zones of seven quasars at @xmath2 to constrain the redshift by which hydrogen reionisation completed. We calibrate the model to reproduce observational constraints on the electron scattering optical depth and photo-ionisation rate. We then calculate the resulting spatially inhomogeneous temperature distribution at different reionisation scenarios. Under standard assumptions for the ionising spectra of population II sources, the temperature measurements constrain the redshift by which hydrogen reionisation was completed to be @xmath4 @xmath5 at 68 (95%) confidence. The measurements provide a powerful constraint on the redshift by which hydrogen reionisation completed, and are an important stepping stone in extending the power of temperature measurements of the igm. These measurements can be tightened and generalised in the future with measurements around other high redshift quasars.", "label": "dolly"}
{"text": "Parkinson s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease with heterogeneous pathological and clinical features. Cognitive dysfunction is a frequent non-motor complication, with varying degrees of severity. Cognitive dysfunction is a risk factor for poor prognosis and shows inter-individual variation in its progression. A variety of studies have tried to identify biomarkers of PD progression. The Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) study is the largest study to date, enrolling drug-naïve and very early stage PD patients. The baseline characteristics of the PPMI cohort have recently been published. The diagnostic utility of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, including alpha-synuclein (ASyn), total tau, phosphorylated tau at Thr181 (ptau), and amyloid 1-42 (A1-42), has been shown to be poor. However, the PPMI data suggested that the measurement of CSF biomarkers can be used to predict cognitive decline in PD patients. To further elucidate the relationship between Alzheimer's pathology and -synuclein pathology, longitudinal observational studies must be followed.

This physics-based signal grooming, performed in the analog domain before digitization, results in compression of the digital data size. The proposed transform is inspired by operation of the fovea centralis in the human eye and by anamorphic transformations in the visual arts.

In this paper, we expose the empirical evidence for discrete GDP-tubulin fluctuations between a curved and a straight configuration at room temperature, as well as for conformational tubulin cooperativity. Guided by a number of experimental findings, we build the case for a novel microtubule model, with the principal result that microtubules can spontaneously form micron-sized cooperative helical states. The polymorphic dynamics of the microtubule lattice resulting from the tubulin bistability quantitatively explains several experimental puzzles, including anomalous scaling of dynamic fluctuations of grafted microtubules, their apparent length-stiffness relation, and their remarkably curved helical appearance in general. We point out that tubulin dimers' multistability and its cooperative switching could participate in important cellular processes, and could in particular lead to efficient mechanochemical signalling along single microtubules.", "label": "dolly"}

Events with a B(0) carrying large transverse momentum and decaying leptonically lead to large missing energy and are of particular importance.

The polarization fractions are very stable with respect to QCD corrections.  The leptonic decays of B(4) bosons translates the common left-handed polarization into an effective experimental handle on separating B(0)+jets from top quark production, which exhibits very little asymmetry due to C invariance, and from various types of new physics.

Batman: the Animated Series didn't just celebrate other stories, they celebrated ideas, too. What about when Leslie Thompkins and Batman offered each other dueling Santayana quotes? Remember later in that same episode when Bruce quoted Nietzche? The Animated Series planted subversive seeds that would disrupt the simple good vs. evil narratives we had been force-fed throughout the eighties. New characters created new relationships and dynamics. Harley and the Joker were like Bonnie and Clyde on steroids. Their hysterically dysfunctional relationship made them one of the most fascinating characters in superhero cartoon history.", "label": "dolly"}

{"text": "Flow and transport are studied in transparent model fractures with rough complementary self-affine walls with a relative shear displacement.    The aperture field is shown to display long range correlations perpendicular to the x-axis.  For flow in that direction, the width and geometry of the front of a dyed shear-thinning polymer solution displacing a transparent one have been studied as a function of the fluid rheology and flow rate.   The front width increases linearly with distance indicating a convection of the fluids with a low transverse mixing between the flow paths.  The width also increases with the flow-rate as the fluid rheology shifts from newtonian at low shear rates to a shear-thinning behaviour at higher shear rates.  The width also increases with the polymer concentration at high flow-rates.  These results demonstrate the enhancement of the flow velocity contrasts between different flow channels for shear-thinning fluids.  The relative widths at low and high shear rates for different polymer concentrations are well predicted by an analytical model considering the fracture as a set of parallel ducts of constant hydraulic apertures.  The overall geometry of the experimental front geometry is also predicted by the theoretical model from the aperture map.", "label": "dolly"}

{"text": "We are reporting on a study of the isophotal shapes of early-type galaxies, up to very faint levels of the sky brightness. The galaxies are from the large format camera (LFC) fields obtained using the Palomar Hale Telescope, with integrated exposures ranging from 1 to 4 hours in the SDSS R, I and Z bands. The shapes of isophotes of early-type galaxies are important as they are correlated with the physical properties of the galaxies and are influenced by galaxy formation processes. In this paper, we report on a sample of 132 e and s galaxies in one LFC field. We have redshifts for 53 of these, obtained using AAomega on the Anglo-Australian Telescope. The shapes of early-type galaxies often vary with radius. We derive average values of isophotal shape parameters in four different radial bins along the semi-major axis in each galaxy. We obtain empirical fitting formulae for the probability distribution of the isophotal parameters in each bin and investigate for possible correlations with other global properties of the galaxies. Our main finding is that the isophotal shapes of the inner regions are statistically different from those in the outer regions. This suggests that the outer and inner parts of early-type galaxies have evolved somewhat independently.", "label": "dolly"}

{"text": "In the dynamic and uncertain ubiquitous computing environments, consistency checking can be challenging. This is because contexts are often noisy owing to unreliable sensing data streams, inaccurate data measurement, fragile connectivity and resource constraints. One of the state-of-the-art efforts is Ceda, which concurrently detects context consistency by exploring the \"happened before\" relation among events. However, Ceda suffers from several limitations: it detects context consistency by utilizing a centralized detection manner, which easily gets down the checker process and heavy computing complexity; and the snapshot-based events detection, which limits its scalability and accuracy. In this paper, we propose Seca: snapshot-based event detection for checking asynchronous context consistency in ubiquitous computing. Seca introduces snapshot-based timestamp to detect event relations, which can detect scenarios where Ceda fails. Moreover, it simplifies the logical clock, instead of adopting the vector clock, and thus significantly reduces both time and space complexity. Empirical studies show that Seca outperforms Ceda in terms of detection accuracy, scalability and computing complexity.", "label": "dolly"}

{"text": "A spiral galaxy partially overlapping a more distant elliptical can offer a unique opportunity to measure the dust extinction in the foreground spiral. Using data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, we selected occulting galaxy pairs and measured disk opacity over the redshift range. We expected the enrichment of the interstellar medium (ISM) to change over the lifetime of a disk and, when it does, the change would affect our measurements of galaxies over the observable universe. By selecting the dr4 spectroscopic catalog, we found that the spiral disks show evidence of extinction to the effective radius of 2. When no recent evolution of disk opacity is detected, it is possible that other factors such as the presence of spiral arms and Hubble type affect disk opacity. So, the limited redshift range and the inability to distinguish other factors make it difficult to detect evolution of disk opacity. High resolution spectra are needed to disentangle the effects of spiral arms and hubble type on disk opacity.   The Sloan digital sky survey pairs allow us to detect occulting pairs in a uniform and consistent way. However, more detailed investigations with higher resolution images of disks are needed to detect any evolution of disk opacity.", "label": "dolly"}

{"text": "Large scale strong magnetic fields in galaxies are generally thought to have been generated by a stochastic, turbulent dynamo. In order to have generated the fields observed, the dynamo would have had to have operated for a sufficiently long period of time. However, magnetic fields of similar intensities and scales to the one in our galaxy are observed in high redshift galaxies, where a stochastic dynamo would not have had time to produce the observed fields. Instead of a mean field dynamo, we study the emergence of strong large scale magnetic fields in the first objects formed in the universe due to the action of a turbulent helical stochastic dynamo. Ambipolar drift plays an important role in this process due to the low level of ionization of the gas, allowing a stochastic dynamo to operate. We take into account the uncertainties in the physics of high redshift objects by examining a range of values for the parameters that characterize the turbulent plasma. By numerically integrating the nonlinear evolution equations for magnetic field correlations, we show that for reasonable values of the parameters in the time interval considered, fields can grow to high intensities and with large coherence lengths, essentially independent of the initial values of the magnetic field.", "label": "dolly"}

Methods - To examine the effects of tnf-induced inflammation, we injected acute, brief, or chronic exposures of tnf in neonatal and juvenile mice. Results - tnf induced significant villus blunting through a Tnf receptor-1 (tnfr1)-mediated mechanism, leading to loss of villus area. This response to tnfr1 signaling was altered during intestinal development, despite constant tnfr1 protein expression. Acute tnf-mediated signaling also significantly decreased paneth cells. Conclusions - Taken together, the morphologic changes caused by tnf provide insight into the effects of inflammation on the developing intestinal tract. Additionally, these changes suggest a mechanism which, coupled with an immature immune system, may help to explain the unique susceptibility of the immature intestine to inflammatory diseases such as necrosis.", "label": "dolly"}
{"text": "World number one Jason Day, Rory McIlroy and Shane Lowry have all pulled out of the tournament due to concerns about the Zika virus. Garcia, 36, said that he knew of the dangers, but representing Spain and being an Olympian was “too important”. Zimbabwe’s Brendon de Jonge has also withdrawn, but cited business reasons. Masters winner Danny Willett said earlier this week that he is willing to “risk” a trip to Brazil to compete in August. The Zika virus is mosquito-borne and has been linked to defects in newborn babies, prompting those looking to start a family to take extra precautions. Olympic chiefs and the World Health Organisation have issued guidance for athletes and visitors to Rio, and say the risk of catching Zika is low. Meanwhile, De Jonge’s decision to withdraw comes as competing in Rio would mean missing two PGA Tour events. De Jonge is 160th on the FedEx Cup points list and needs to finish in the top 125 at the end of the season to keep full playing rights.

Despite the excellent story, the movie could have been better. The movie is pretty long but at the end I was feeling like some things were missing. Sound effects and sound tracks were very good. Acting was well done but the character development phase was weak. For people who didn't read the book, things may seem happening too quickly. From my point of view, instead of trying to put as much as stuff from the book, they could have tried to do the important scenes more proper. What makes the book very good was all the puzzle like story combined with the excellent portrait of Vatican. You don't see it in the movie. Too much rush and using the time not in a good way, these are main problems of the movie. So, it is worth watching but could have been done better.", "label": "dolly"}

Portuguese-born agency nurse Isabel Amaro, age 47, was convicted of manslaughter by gross negligence. The jury is deliberating on the same charge for two other medics - Dr Hadiza Bawa-Garba and nurse Theresa Taylor. Jack, who had a heart condition, was admitted to the hospital with pneumonia and died from a cardiac arrest after sepsis was triggered by a bacterial infection about 11 hours later. The trial has heard the boy's death was caused by \"serious neglect on the part of the doctor and the two nurses\". They failed to recognise his body was \"shutting down\" due to sepsis and close to death, the prosecution claimed. Nurse Amaro, who had worked with children for 20 years, admitted she breached her duty of care but denied any of her failings were criminally negligent or significantly contributed to the youngster's death. The prosecution had said Amaro's record-keeping of the boy's life signs, regarded by experts as basic nursing practice, had been \"woefully inaccurate\". The court was also told that Dr Bawa-Garba - who along with Ms Taylor denies the manslaughter charge - had mixed him up with another patient and mistakenly believed he had a \"do not resuscitate\" order. She ordered resuscitation to start again a few minutes later, after another doctor checked the boy's notes. She previously told the court working without a break may have led to the mistake.

We emphasize that such effects should be taken into account to better understand the recently discovered heavy-fermion superconductor CePt$_3$Si. Considering electron correlation effects in a formally exact way, we obtain the expression of the magnetoelectric coefficient for the Zeeman-field-induced paramagnetic supercurrent, of which the existence was predicted more than a decade ago. Our result indicates that in contrast to the usual Meissner current, which is greatly reduced by the mass renormalization factor in the heavy-fermion state, the paramagnetic supercurrent is not affected by the fermi liquid effect. This implies that experimental observation of the magnetoelectric effect is more feasible in heavy-fermion systems than in conventional metals with moderate effective mass.", "label": "dolly"}

{"text": "Previous sub-millimetre (submm) observations of cool dust emission detected at @xmath0 around the luminous blue variable (lbv) star @xmath1 Carinae.  These observations were hindered by the low declination of @xmath1 Carinae and contamination from free-free emission originating from the stellar wind.  Here, we present deep sub-millimetre observations with Laboca at 870 m, taken shortly after a maximum in the 5.5 yr radio cycle.  We find a significant difference in the sub-millimetre flux measured here compared with the previous measurement.  This is the first indication of variability at sub-millimetre wavelengths.  A comparison of the sub-millimetre structures with ionised emission features suggests that the 870 m is dominated by emission from the ionised wind and not thermal emission from dust.  We estimate a dust mass of about.  The spatial distribution of the sub-millimetre emission limits the mass loss to within the last thousand years and is associated with mass ejected during the great eruptions and the pre-outburst lbv wind phase.

{"text": "Kepler 11145123 is a distant, slowly rotating star with a radius more than twice the size of the Sun. Researchers were able to show that the difference between the equatorial and polar radii was just 3km. This makes Kepler 11145123 the roundest natural object ever measured, even more round than the Sun. Asteroseismology, which is the study of the oscillations of stars, was used to observe the star's changes in brightness, from which the periodic expansions and contractions of Kepler 11145123 could be derived. Using the method, researchers discovered that the star rotated more quickly at its surface than its core. This distortion was probably caused by factors other than rotation alone, such as a weak magnetic field. The difference of 3km between the polar and equatorial radii is tiny compared to the star's mean radius of 1.5 million km.

We analyze the dynamics of both the trace distance and the quantum capacity, and show that the behavior of non-Markovianity based on both measures is qualitatively similar.

{"text": "Large scale strong magnetic fields in galaxies are generally thought to have been generated by a turbulent mean field dynamo in order to have generated the fields observed. However, magnetic fields of similar intensities and scales to those in our galaxy are observed in high redshift galaxies, where a mean field dynamo would not have had time to produce the observed fields. Instead of a mean field dynamo, we study the emergence of strong large scale magnetic fields in the first objects formed in the universe due to the action of a turbulent stochastic dynamo, for redshifts of @xmath0. Ambipolar drift plays an important role in this process due to the low level of ionization of the gas, allowing a large scale stochastic dynamo to operate. We take into account the uncertainties in the physics of high redshift objects by examining a range of values for the parameters that characterize the turbulent plasma. By numerically integrating the nonlinear evolution equations for magnetic field correlations, we show that for reasonable values of the parameters in the time interval considered, fields can grow to high intensities (of @xmath1 g) with large coherence lengths (of @xmath2 kpc), essentially independent of the initial values of the magnetic field.", "label": "dolly"}

Even in a casual conversation, these women are discussing what men like his daughters’ father are doing wrong. And they’re expressing their views and wishes. Is it easy to hear it? Well, it is for women like Storm, who’ve been given a platform from which to speak. But still, this doesn’t make up for the anguish he’ll feel when asked ‘What would you have done differently?’. Despite the lighthearted attitude, he’s grateful that these women are speaking up. It’s certainly helped to break some of the ice.

The piece is from the Spanish artist Picasso, who is credited with pioneering the Cubist movement in the early twentieth century. It was previously owned by British painter Lucian Freud, who gifted it to Arts Council England, with the intent of donating the piece to the National Museums Liverpool. The art piece features a religious theme of St Anthony the Great, who is said to have faced temptation in the Egyptian desert. Picasso is considered an influential figure in the twentieth century, and his rendition of the scene seems to illustrate the artist's early cubist style. The painting was created using ink and wash, and it is said to be both beautiful and sensual. This piece of art is being displayed at a prominent location, as it is a testament to the artist's talent and the skill of his artisans.

{"text": "The influence of the quadrupole shape fluctuations on the dipole vibrations in transitional nuclei is investigated in the framework of the instantaneous shape sampling model, which combines the interacting boson model for the slow collective quadrupole motion and the random phase approximation for the rapid dipole vibrations. Coupling to the complex background configurations is taken into account by folding the results with a lorentzian with an energy dependent width. The low energy energy portion of the absorption cross section, which is important for photo-nuclear processes, is studied for the isotopic series of kr, xen, ba, and sm. The experimental cross sections are well reproduced. The low energy cross section is determined by the Landau fragmentation of the dipole strength and its redistribution caused by the shape fluctuations. Collisional damping only wipes out fluctuations of the absorption cross section, generating the smooth energy dependence observed in experiment. In the case of semi-magic nuclei, shallow pygmy resonances are found in agreement with experiment.", "label": "dolly"}

{"text": "Premature infants are often subject to inflammation in their developing intestines. Since the human small intestine does not reach maturity until term gestation, premature infants have a unique challenge, as either acute or chronic inflammation may alter the normal development of the intestinal tract. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) has been shown to acutely alter goblet cell numbers and villus length in adult mice. In this study, we tested the effects of TNF-induced inflammation, at different stages of development, on intestinal architecture and epithelial cells. Methods. To examine the effects of TNF-mediated inflammation, we injected acute, brief, or chronic exposures of TNF in neonatal and juvenile mice. Results. TNF induced significant villus blunting through a TNF receptor-1 (TNFR1) mediated mechanism, leading to loss of villus area. This response to TNFR1 signaling was altered during intestinal development, despite constant TNFR1 protein expression. Acute TNF-mediated signaling also significantly decreased paneth cells. Conclusions. Taken together, the morphological changes caused by TNF provide insight as to the effects of inflammation on the developing intestinal tract. Additionally, they suggest a mechanism which, coupled with an immature immune system, may explain the unique susceptibility of the immature intestine to inflammatory diseases such as NEC.", "label": "dolly"}

We also find that environments with a spectrum that contains a relevant low-frequency contribution are generally non-markovian. We also find that the non-markovianity of colored environments decreases when the number of fluctuators realizing the environment increases.", "label": "dolly"}

{"text": "Spike timing has been shown to carry detailed stimulus information at the sensory periphery.  However, the role of spike timing in network computation is less clear.  Most models of computation by neural networks are based on population firing rates.  In equivalent spiking implementations, firing is assumed to be random such that averaging across populations of neurons recovers the rate-based approach.  Recently, Denve and colleagues have suggested that the spiking behavior of neurons may be fundamental to how neural networks compute, with precise spike timing determined by each neuron's contribution to producing the desired output.  By postulating that each neuron fires in order to reduce the error in the network's output, it was demonstrated that linear computations can be carried out by networks of integrate-and-fire neurons that communicate through instantaneous synapses.  This left open, however, the possibility that realistic networks with conductance-based neurons and subthreshold nonlinearity and the slower timescales of biophysical synapses may not fit into this framework.  Here, we show how the spike-based approach can be extended to biophysically plausible networks.  We then show that our model reproduces a number of key features of cortical networks, including irregular and poisson-like spike times and a tight balance between excitation and inhibition.  Finally, we discuss how the behavior of our model scales with network size or with the number of neurons recorded from a larger computing network.  These results significantly increase the biological plausibility of the spike-based approach to network computation.", "label": "dolly"}

{"text": "uropathogenic Escherichia coli ( upec ) is a causative agent of urinary tract infections ( utis ), including cystitis and pyelonephritis. Upec expresses a multitude of virulence factors to breach the mucosal barrier, leading to the induction of host inflammatory responses. These responses include secretion of cytokines, influx of neutrophils, and the exfoliation of infected bladder epithelial cells. Several signaling pathways activated during upec infection, such as those known to activate the innate immune response, interact with calcium-dependent signaling pathways. Some upec isolates, however, possess strategies to delay or suppress the activation of components of the innate host response in the urinary tract. Studies published in the recent past provide new information regarding how virulence factors of uropathogenic Escherichia coli are involved in the activation of the innate host response.

In particular, the framework applies to dung argumentation frameworks ( dafs ), setafs by Nielson and Parsons, and bipolar adfs. We present a uniform characterization method for the admissible, complete, preferred and model/stable semantics. We employ this method to devise an algorithm that decides realizability for the mentioned formalisms and semantics. Moreover, the algorithm allows for constructing a desired knowledge base whenever one exists. The algorithm is built in a modular way and thus easily extensible to new formalisms and semantics.

It can create a situation where it is more beneficial for some people to have a larger amount of wealth than others. As an example, if a wealthy person can buy a summer home that provides less utility to a homeless family of five, it represents reduced \"distributive efficiency\" within society. It decreases marginal utility of wealth and thus the sum total of personal utility. A dollar spent by a poor person will go to basic necessities like food, water, and healthcare; while, an additional dollar spent by a much richer person will most likely go to luxury items providing relatively less utility to that person. As a result, the marginal utility of wealth per person decreases as a person becomes richer.

Using these results, we present a model for the evolution of Cassiopeia A and find that it's expansion is well fit by a ejecta profile running into a circumstellar wind. We further find that while the position of the reverse shock in this model is consistent with that measured in X-rays, to match the forward shock velocity and radius we had to assume that 30% of the explosion energy has gone into accelerating cosmic rays at the forward shock. The new X-ray images also show that brightness variations can occur for some forward shock filaments, like those seen for several nonthermal filaments projected in the interior of the remnant.

This is made possible by first obtaining an exact solution of the mean spherical approximation for hard core plus Yukawa potentials in the limit of infinite amplitude and vanishing range of the attractive tail, with their product remaining constant. The choice of factorizable coupling (stickiness) parameters in the Yukawa term yields a simpler dyadic structure in the fourier transform of the Baxter factor correlation function, with a remarkable simplification in all structure factors with respect to previous works. The effect of size and stickiness polydispersity is analyzed, and numerical results are presented for two particular versions of the model: when all polydisperse particles have a single, size-independent, stickiness parameter, and when the stickiness parameters are proportional to the diameters. The existence of two different regimes for the average structure factor, respectively above and below a generalized boyle temperature which depends on size polydispersity, is recognized and discussed.

As an example of this non-triviality, we have calculated the electromagnetic current for scalar bosons in the background field method, where the covariance is restored through considering the complete Fock space of solutions. We also show that the method of dislocating the integration pole is nothing more than a particular case of this, so that such an ad-hoc prescription can be dispensed altogether if we deal with the whole Fock space. In this work, we construct the electromagnetic current operator for a system composed of two free bosons. The technique employed to deduce these operators is through the definition of global propagators in the light front when a background electromagnetic field acts on one of the particles.", "label": "dolly"}
{"text": "Gamma rays from extragalactic sources are attenuated by pair-production interactions with diffuse photons of the extragalactic background light. Gamma-ray bursts are a source of high-redshift photons above 10 GeV, and could be therefore useful as a probe of the evolving ultraviolet background radiation. In this paper, we develop a simple phenomenological model for the number and redshift distribution of gamma rays that can be seen at 10 GeV with the Fermi satellite and Magic Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescope. We estimate the observed number of gamma rays per year, and show how this result is modified by considering interactions with different realizations of the evolving ebl. We also discuss the bright GRB 080916C in the context of this model. We find that the Fermi LAT can be expected to see a small number of photons above 10 GeV each year from distant GRBs. Annual results for ground-based instruments like Magic are highly variable due to the low duty cycle and sky coverage of the telescope. However, successfully viewing a bright or intermediate GRB from the ground could provide hundreds of photons from high-redshift, which would almost certainly be extremely useful in constraining both GRB physics and the high-redshift ebl.", "label": "dolly"}

The poison used is extremely toxic and more toxic than was originally thought, and it causes the birds to die of poison before they are able to flee, as they are unable to move quickly enough due to their size. These birds feed on carrion and are particularly susceptible to poisoned baits. A sparrowhawk and two peregrine falcons were also killed. It is heartbreaking to think of the deaths of these birds, but it is disturbing to see the continuing usage of toxic poisons, which also put children, pets, and livestock at risk. The reported incidents are indicative of a pattern of irresponsible use of lethal poisons. They are responsible for the illegal killing of birds of prey. These actions are considered illegal, and the use of highly toxic carbofuran is unacceptable. The county with the most reported incidents was Down, with four cases, while there were two cases in Tyrone. There were one incident in Londonderry, Antrim, and Armagh.

{"text": "Antimicrobial peptides are powerful antimicrobials that possess potent antimicrobial activities against invading microorganisms and contribute to the innate host defense. Human antimicrobial peptides, including human neutrophil peptides and human defensins, are potent bactericidal agents against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. Neutrophils are critical effector cells in host defense against microbial infections, and their lifespan is regulated by various pathogen- and host-derived substances. In this study, we demonstrated that hnps-1, hbd-3, and ll-37 can not only kill bacteria, but can also potently modulate neutrophil apoptosis, accompanied with the phosphorylation of erk-1/-2, the downregulation of tbid, and the upregulation of bcl-xl, as well as the inhibition of mitochondrial membrane potential change and caspase-3 activity. Suppression of neutrophil apoptosis results in the prolongation of their lifespan, which may be advantageous for host defense against bacterial invasion.

{"text": "The Earth's magnetic field is generated by processes within the electrically conducting, liquid outer core, which are referred to as geodynamo.  In the last decades, great effort has been put into the numerical simulation of core dynamics following from magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations.  However, numerical simulations are far from the Earth's core in terms of various control parameters.  Different scaling analyses found simple scaling laws for quantities like heat transport, flow velocity, magnetic field strength, and magnetic dissipation time.  However, in contrast to earlier results, we find that diffusive processes are not negligible for the flow velocity and magnetic field strength in numerical dynamos.  Also, the scaling of the magnetic dissipation time turns out to be more complex than previously suggested.  Assuming that the processes relevant in the numerical models are the same as in Earth's core, we use this scaling to estimate an ohmic dissipation of 3-8 tw for the core.  This appears to be consistent with recent high CMB heat flux scenarios.  This appears to be an important scaling that needs to be taken into account in numerical models of the Earth's core.", "label": "dolly"}

{"text": "The 25a system helps to mediate the anti-viral effects of interferons through its synthesis of 25a, which is the activation of the ribonuclease (RNase) l. RNase l degrades viral and cellular RNA after activation by unique oligoadenylates (25a, (pp)p5a2)n, n2. Both the 25a system and apoptosis can serve as viral defense mechanisms and RNA degradation occurs during both processes, so we investigated the potential role of RNase l in apoptosis. Overexpression of human RNase l by an inducible promoter in NIH3T3 fibroblasts decreased cell viability and triggered apoptosis. Activation of endogenous RNase l specifically with 25a or with dsRNA (dsRNA) induced apoptosis. Inhibition of RNase l with a dominant negative mutant suppressed polyI:C-induced apoptosis in interferon-primed fibroblasts. Moreover, inhibition of RNase l suppressed apoptosis induced by poliovirus. Thus, increased RNase l levels induced apoptosis and inhibition of RNase l activity blocked viral-induced apoptosis. Apoptosis may be one of the antiviral mechanisms regulated by the 25a system.", "label": "dolly"}

In 1805, Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac and Alexander von Humboldt showed that water is formed of two volumes of hydrogen and one volume of oxygen; and by 1811 Amedeo Avogadro had arrived at the correct interpretation of water's composition, based on what is now called Avogadro's law and the assumption of diatomic elemental molecules.\n                         [a]: http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/510588/Gay-Lussac", "label": "dolly"}

These valves have traditionally used a simple lever to restrain a plug valve at the top of the boiler. One end of the lever carries a weight or spring which keeps the valve in place and prevents it from being adjusted unless a seal is illegally broken. This new type of valve uses a spring-loaded valve that can be adjusted, which is locked to prevent operators from tampering with it unless a seal is illegally broken. This safety feature is considerably safer.", "label": "dolly"}

We study arrowroot and potato starch gels, when a droplet of the fluid is sandwiched between two glass plates and compressed. This is unlike Newtonian fluids, where the area increases monotonically in a similar situation. The periphery furthermore develops an instability, which looks similar to saffman-taylor fingers. This is not normally seen under compression. The loading history is also found to affect the manner of spreading.

{"text": "The outer surface usually bears eight comb rows, called swimming-plates, which are used for swimming. The rows are oriented to run from the mouth to the opposite end, and are spaced more or less evenly around the body, although spacing patterns vary by species and in most species the comb rows extend only part of the distance from the mouth towards the aboral pole. The \"combs\" (also called \"ctenes\") run across each row, and each consist of thousands of unusually long cilia, up to 2 millimeters (0.079 in). Unlike conventional cilia and flagella, which has a filament structure arranged in a 9 + 2 pattern, these cilia are arranged in a 9 + 3 pattern, where the extra compact filament is suspected to have a supporting function. These normally beat so that the propulsion stroke is away from the mouth, although they can also reverse direction. Hence ctenophores usually swim in the direction in which the mouth is pointing, unlike jellyfish. When trying to escape predators, one species can accelerate to six times its normal speed; some other species reverse direction as part of their escape behavior, by reversing the power stroke of the comb plate cilia.", "label": "dolly"}

This is a retrospective review of open RF ablation and hepatic resection for colorectal liver metastases between January 1998 and May 2007. All patients with RF ablation were considered to have unresectable disease. In total, 58 patients underwent hepatic resection and 43 patients underwent RF ablation. Five-year survival was 43% after hepatic resection and 23% after RF ablation. For patients with solitary lesions, 5-year survival was 48% after hepatic resection and 15% after RF ablation. Sixty percent of patients experienced local recurrence after RF ablation compared to 7% after hepatic resection. This study supports the consensus that RF ablation is inferior to hepatic resection. The results observed in this study support the conclusion that RF ablation cannot be considered an equivalent procedure to hepatic resection.

{"text": "This paper presents a new model of north polar coronal hole ( npch ) to study dissipation / propagation of mhd waves. We investigate the effects of the isotropic viscosity and heat conduction on the propagation characteristics of the mhd waves in npch. First, we model npch by considering the differences in radial as well as in the direction perpendicular to the line of sight (los) in temperature, particle number density and non-thermal velocities between plumes and interplume lanes for the specific case of ions. This model includes parallel and perpendicular heat conduction and viscous dissipation. Next, we derive the dispersion relations for the mhd waves in the case of absence and presence of parallel heat conduction. In the case of absence of parallel heat conduction, we find that mhd wave dissipation strongly depends on the viscosity for modified acoustic and alfven waves. The energy flux density of acoustic waves varies between 0.5 and 1. The energy flux density of alven waves turned out to be between 1.5 and 2. But, solutions of the magnetoacoustic waves show that the parallel heat conduction introduces anomalous dispersion to the npch plasma, wherein the group velocity of waves exceeds the speed of light in vacuum. Our results suggests all these waves may provide significant source for the observed preferential accelerating and heating of ions, in turn coronal plasma heating and an extra accelerating agent for fast solar wind in npch.

{"text": "Cardiac arrest has been described in children with diabetic ketoacidosis (dka), indicating the need for monitoring. Our aim was to evaluate QT interval and QT dispersion (Qtd) in type 1 diabetic children with dka at presentation and recovery. Twelve-lead ECG was performed to 30 type 1 diabetic children with dka at presentation and recovery. Corrected QT interval and QT dispersion (Qtd) were assessed. Results: Qtc and Qtd mean values were significantly decreased in patients after than before dka recovery (p < 0.01). Procedure: Sixteen patients (53.3%) had prolonged Qtc during dka that dropped to one after recovery, his Qtc returning to normal 5 days after hospital discharge. Nineteen patients (63.3%) had prolonged Qtd that dropped to three after recovery. The fact that three patients had normal Qtc but prolonged Qtd increases the privilege of Qtd over Qtc as a better marker for cardiac risk in those patients. Anion gap was significantly associated with Qtc and Qtd prolongation (p < 0.0001). Patients had no electrolyte abnormalities or hypoglycemia to account for Qtc or Qtd prolongation. Conclusion: Prolonged Qtc and Qtd frequently occur in dka positively correlated to ketosis. Cardiac monitoring for patients with dka is mandatory.", "label": "dolly"}

We express the fourier transform of the joint probability density of the process to reach given values at several different times, as well as the fourier transform of the joint density of the process to reach a given maximal value in a given time period. Then we consider a portfolio composed of stocks and of options on stocks, and derive the fourier transform of a random variable, defined as the deviation of the portfolio, which is the product of a small temporal change of the portfolio and the compound interest earned. We derive a functional equation for the price of the option on the stock, as a function of the stock, subject to the condition that the deviation of the portfolio has a zero mean.

{"text": "Central venous catheters (CVC) are commonly used in intensive care units, and catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI) remain a leading cause of healthcare-associated infections, particularly in preterm infants. Increased survival rate of extremely low-birth-weight infants can be partly attributed to routine practice of CVC placement. The most common types of CVC used in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) include umbilical venous catheters, peripherally inserted central catheters, and tunneled catheters. CRBSI is defined as a laboratory-confirmed bloodstream infection (BSI) with either a positive catheter tip culture or a positive blood culture drawn from the CVC. BSI is usually associated with several risk factors, including prolonged catheter placement, femoral access, low birth weight, and young gestational age. Most NICUs have a strategy for CVC insertion and maintenance designed to reduce CRBSI. Specific interventions vary slightly between NICUs, particularly with regard to the types of disinfectants used for hand hygiene and appropriate skin care for the infant.

Furthermore, it allows for a satisfactory anthropic explanation of the cosmological constant problem by producing a smooth, and approximately constant, distribution of potentially observable values of the cosmological constant. The low-energy vacua selected by this measure are often short-lived. If we require anthropically acceptable vacua to have a minimum life-time of 10 billion years, then for reasonable parameters a typical observer should expect their vacuum to have a life-time of approximately 12 billion years.

{"text": "We examine the hypothesis that quasars and early-type galaxies have coevally formed. This hypothesis is backed up by stellar population synthesis models, and the relationship between black hole mass and the bulge velocity dispersion, and the spheroid velocity dispersion distribution from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. All of these allow us to reconstruct the cosmic accretion history of supermassive black holes. In the optical, the precise shape of the luminosity function of quasars also depends on the light curve of quasars and, in the X-ray band, on the covering factor of the dust surrounding the active nucleus. We find that this possible set of assumptions is consistent with the observed b-band and X-ray luminosity functions of quasars.", "label": "dolly"}

{"text": "The government has agreed on a new law to crack down on anti-Polish hate speech. The ruling Law and Justice Party has a clear majority in parliament. Phrases like “Polish concentration camps” will be punishable by up to three years in jail. Millions died in Nazi German camps on Polish soil. Under the new law it will be illegal to suggest “publicly and contrary to the facts” that Poles participated in, or bore any responsibility for, the crimes of the Third Reich, a Polish Justice Ministry statement said. Millions of people, mostly Jews, from across Europe were killed in six German-run extermination camps in occupied Poland. Further Holocaust atrocities were committed in Nazi concentration camps and ghettos in Poland. The country was occupied by the Nazis between 1939 and 1945. The murders wiped out 90% of Poland’s pre-war Jewish population. The ministry statement said the new law “will effectively combat the lies detrimental to the good image and good name of Poland, reproduced mainly by foreign media”. Why did ordinary people commit atrocities in the Holocaust? Polish leader vows anti-Semitism fight There were, however, some Polish atrocities against Jews and other civilians during and after the war. In 1941, Polish villagers in Jedwabne, perhaps at the instigation of the Nazis, rounded up more than 300 of their Jewish neighbours and burned them alive in a barn.

{"text": "This study aimed to investigate the influence of bone quality and surgical technique on the implant stability quotient (ISQ) value. In addition, the influence of interfacial bone quality, directly surrounding the implant fixture, on the resonance frequency of the structure was evaluated. Materials and methods – Two different types of bone (type 1 and type 2) were extracted and trimmed from pig rib bone. In each type of bone, the same implants were installed in three different ways: (1) compaction, (2) self-tapping, and (3) tapping. The ISQ value was measured and analyzed to evaluate the influence of bone quality and surgical technique on the implant primary stability. For finite element analysis, a three dimensional implant fixture-bone structure was designed and the fundamental resonance frequency of the structure was measured with three different density of interfacial bone surrounding the implant fixture. Results – In each group, the ISQ values were higher in type 1 bone than those in type 2 bone. Among three different insertion methods, the tapping group showed the lowest ISQ value in both type 1 and type 2 bones. Increased interfacial bone density raised the resonance frequency value in the finite element analysis. Conclusion – Both bone quality and surgical technique have influence on the implant primary stability, and resonance frequency has a positive relation with the density of implant fixture-surrounding bone.", "label": "dolly"}

Our 0.69.5 keV spectra penetrated to the black hole core of this Seyfert and revealed heavy and complex intrinsic X-ray absorption. Both total and single partial covering models failed to acceptably fit the observed absorption, and partial covering or partial covering plus warm absorption appears to be required.  The double partial covering model provides the best statistical fit to the data, and we measure large column densities of $320$ ($\\rm cm^{-2}$) irrespective of the particular spectral model under consideration.  These X-ray columns are over an order of magnitude larger than expected based on observations at longer wavelengths.  Our data suggest that most of the X-ray absorption occurs either in gas that has a relatively small amount of dust or in gas that is located within the broad line region. The X-ray absorber may well be the putative `atmosphere` above the torus that collimates the ionization cone.

{"text": "The next generation of cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments, galaxy surveys, and high-redshift observations can potentially determine the nature of the dark matter observationally. With this in mind, we introduce a phenomenological model for a generalized dark matter (GDm) component and discuss its effect on large-scale structure and CMB anisotropies. Specifying the gravitational influence of the otherwise non-interacting GDm requires not only a model for its equation of state but one for its full stress tensor. From consideration of symmetries, conservation laws, and gauge invariance, we construct a simple but powerful 3 component parameterization of these stresses that exposes the new phenomena produced by GDm. Limiting cases include a particle component (e.g. WIMPs, radiation or massive neutrinos), a cosmological constant, and a scalar field component. Intermediate cases illustrate how the clustering properties of the dark matter can be specified independently of its equation of state. This freedom allows one to alter the amplitude and features in the matter power spectrum relative to those of the CMB anisotropies while leaving the background cosmology fixed. Conversely, observational constraints on such phenomena can help determine the nature of the dark matter.", "label": "dolly"}
{"text": "Due to the recent cases of algorithmic bias in data-driven decision making, the machine learning methods are being put under the microscope in order to understand the root cause of these biases and how to correct them. Here, we consider a basic algorithmic task that is central in machine learning: subsampling from a large data set. Subsamples are used both as an end goal in data summarization (where fairness could either be a legal, political or moral requirement) and to train algorithms (where biases in the samples are often a source of bias in the resulting model). Consequently, there is a growing effort to modify either the subsampling methods or the algorithms themselves in order to ensure fairness. However, in doing so, a question that seems to be overlooked is whether it is possible to produce fair subsamples that are also adequately representative of the feature space of the data set. An important and classic requirement in machine learning. Can diversity and fairness be simultaneously ensured? We start by noting that, in some applications, guaranteeing one does not necessarily guarantee the other, and a new approach is required. Subsequently, we present an algorithmic framework which allows us to produce both fair and diverse samples. Our experimental results on an image summarization task show marked improvements in fairness without compromising feature diversity by much, giving us the best of both the worlds.", "label": "dolly"}

This paper compares the estimates from the different studies to adjust the original estimates to reflect central empirical estimates of key elasticities. This analysis illustrates the drawbacks of relying on the open economy model, such as the need for adjustment in the short run to more accurately reflect the real-world effects. The paper also presents an alternative approach that draws on the property tax and allocates the burden based on the central estimate of global average corporate taxes. This alternative method indicates that capital bears the full burden of the worldwide corporate taxes and that the open-economy assumption is not sufficient to shift the burden of the corporate tax from capital to labor.", "label": "dolly"}

{"text": "The common aim of transcranial stimulation methods is the induction or alterations of cortical excitability in a controlled way. Significant effects of each individual stimulation method have been published, however, conclusive direct comparisons of many of these methods are rare. The aim of the present study was to compare the efficacy of three widely applied stimulation methods inducing excitability enhancement in the motor cortex: 1mA anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (atdcs), intermittent theta burst stimulation (itbs) and 1mA transcranial random noise stimulation (trns). The effect of each stimulation condition was quantified by evaluating motor-evoked potential amplitudes in a fixed time sequence after stimulation. The analyses confirmed a significant enhancement of the m1 excitability caused by all three types of active stimulations compared to sham. There was no significant difference between the types of active stimulations, however, the time course of the excitatory effects slightly differed. Among the stimulation methods, trns resulted in the strongest and atdcs significantly longest mep increase compared to sham. Different time courses of the applied stimulation methods suggest different underlying mechanisms of action. Better understanding may be useful for better targeting of different transcranial stimulation techniques.", "label": "dolly"}

Adopting a self consistent description of local and extra-galactic substructures, we show that the annihilation flux from substructures in the milky way dominates over all the other components for angles larger than 1 degree from the galactic center, unless an extreme prescription is adopted for the substructures concentration. We also compute the angular power spectrum of gamma-ray anisotropies and find that, for an optimistic choice of the particle physics parameters, an interesting signature of dark matter annihilations could soon be discovered by the Fermi satellite at low multipoles, where the dominant contribution comes from milky way substructures with mass.

This construction requires an additional two-index stckelberg field, beyond the four scalar fields used in the metric formulation, and unveils a new local sl(4) symmetry group of the mass and potential terms, not shared by the einstein-Hilbert term.  The new field is auxiliary, but transforms as a vector under two different lorentz groups: one of them is the group of local lorentz transformations, the other is an additional global group.  This formulation enables a geometric interpretation of the mass and potential terms for gravity in terms of certain volume forms.  Furthermore, we find that the decoupling limit is much simpler to extract in this approach; in particular, we are able to derive expressions for the interactions of the vector modes.  We also note that it is possible to extend the theory by promoting the two-index auxiliary field into a nambu-goldstone boson nonlinearly realizing a certain spacetime symmetry, and show how it is eaten up by the antisymmetric part of the vierbein.", "label": "dolly"}

These sites may contain anywhere from several dozen to almost 20,000 mutations for a given gene. Many of these mutations are uncharacterised and have no known effects on the gene product, the 'variant of uncertain significance' (VUS). In this paper, the statistics of mutation distribution are examined for six different genes: Brca1 and Brca2, Haemoglobin Beta (HBB), HPRT1, CFTR and TP53. The percentage of all possible point mutations for a protein (the mutation space) is calculated for each gene and the question 'how much mutation data is enough?' is raised.", "label": "dolly"}

These may play a role in the extension of ulcerative colitis (UC) into the terminal ileum. We sought to clarify the magnified endoscopic findings of PPS in the terminal ileum of UC patients. Eighteen UC patients underwent magnifying chromoendoscopy before initial treatment to evaluate the follicle-associated epithelium (Fae) on PPS domes and the surrounding villi. In 8 UC patients, PPS domes were slightly elevated and covered with regular Fae lining, and were surrounded by dense and bulky villi; however, in 10 UC patients, the PPS domes were irregular and the surrounding villi were sparse and atrophic. These abnormal findings within the PPS were associated with minimal mucosal lesions but not with backwash ileitis. Similar to Crohn s disease patients, UC patients commonly had abnormalities in Fae on PPS domes and the surrounding villi on magnifying endoscopy.

We find a model-independent tension between the SZ and the X-ray pressure, with the SZ one being definitely lower by a factor of a few. We propose that this challenging tension can be resolved in terms of an additional, non-thermal support to the gravitational equilibrium of the intracluster plasma. Possible origins of the nonthermal component include cosmic-ray protons, ongoing turbulence, and relativistic electrons. For this to be effective, we find that the electron population must include energetic electrons responsible for the radio halo and many more, lower energy electrons.

However, a deep characterization of the immunological properties of DOC, including their effect on dendritic cell (DC) function, is not available. DOC can be used either as cellular suspension (detached DOC, det-DOC) or as adherent cells implanted on scaffolds (adherent DOC, adh-DOC). By mimicking these two different routes of administration, we show that both det-DOC and adh-DOC can modulate DC functions. Specifically, the weak downregulation of CD80 and CD86 caused by det-DOC on DC results in a weak modulation of DC function, which retain a high capacity to induce T-cell proliferation and to generate CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ T cells. Moreover, det-DOC can enhance the DC capacity to differentiate CD4+CD161+CD196+TH17-cells by upregulating IL-6 secretion. Conversely, adh-DOC strongly suppress DC functions by a profound downregulation of CD80 and CD86 on DC as well as by inhibiting TGF- production. In conclusion, we demonstrate that different types of DOC cell preparation may have a different impact on the modulation of the host immune system.

{"text": "It has been shown that the causal structure associated to string-like solutions of the Fadeev-Niemi (FN) model is described by an effective metric. Remarkably, the surfaces characterizing the causal replacement depend on the energy momentum tensor of the background soliton and carry implicitly a topological invariant. As a consequence, the pre-image curves in nontrivially define directions where the cones remain unchanged. It turns out that these results may be of importance in understanding time-dependent solutions (collisions/scatterings) numerically or analytically.", "label": "dolly"}
{"text": "The nuclear liquid-gas phase transition in ideal thermal equilibrium is studied with antisymmetrized molecular dynamics.   The time evolution of a many-nucleon system confined in a container is solved for a long time to get a microcanonical ensemble of a given energy and volume.  The temperature and the pressure are extracted from this ensemble and the caloric curves are constructed.  The present work is the first time that a microscopic dynamical model which describes nuclear multifragmentation reactions well is directly applied to get the nuclear caloric curve.  The obtained constant pressure caloric curves clearly show the characteristic feature of the liquid-gas phase transition, namely negative heat capacity (backbending) which is expected for the phase transition in finite systems.", "label": "dolly"}

{"text": "A systematic study of both classical and quantum geometric frustrated ising models with a competing ordering mechanism is reported in this paper. In the classical case, the ordering comes from a coupling of 2d layers, while in the quantum model, it is induced by the quantum dynamics of a transverse field. Mapping the ising models on a triangular lattice to elastic lattices of non-crossing strings, we derive an exact relation between the spin variables and the displacement field of the strings. Using this map both for the classical (2+1)d stacked model and the quantum frustrated 2d system, we obtain a microscopic derivation of an effective hamiltonian which was proposed before on phenomenological grounds within a Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson approach. In contrast to the latter approach, our derivation provides the coupling constants and hence the entire transverse field versus temperature phase diagram can be deduced, including the universality classes of both the quantum and the finite temperature transitions. The structure of the ordered phase is obtained from a detailed entropy argument. We compare our predictions to recent simulations of the quantum system and find good agreement. We also analyze the connections to a dimer model on the hexagonal lattice and its height profile representation, providing a simple derivation of the continuum free energy and a physical explanation for the universality of the stiffness of the height profile for anisotropic couplings.", "label": "dolly"}
{"text": "The charge fluctuations of two nearby mesoscopic conductors coupled only via the long range Coulomb force are discussed and used to find the dephasing rate that one conductor exerts on the other. The discussion is based on a formulation of the scattering approach for charge densities and the density response to a fluctuating potential. Coupling to the Poisson equation results in an electrically self-consistent description of charge fluctuations. At equilibrium, the low-frequency noise power can be expressed with the help of a charge relaxation resistance (which together with the capacitance determines the RC-time of the structure). In the presence of transport, the low-frequency charge noise power is determined by a resistance which reflects the presence of shot noise. We use these results to derive expressions for the dephasing rates of Coulomb coupled conductors and to find a self-consistent expression for the measurement time.", "label": "dolly"}
{"text": "We propose a method to reduce the relaxation time in stochastic sampling of complex energy landscapes in statistical systems with discrete degrees of freedom. We start from a master equation instead of the Fokker-Planck equation for the continuous case. The master equation is transformed into an imaginary-time Schrödinger equation. The hamiltonian of the Schrödinger equation is modified by adding a projector to its known ground state. We show how this transformation decreases the relaxation time and propose a way to use it to accelerate simulated annealing for optimization problems. We implement our method in a simplified kinetic Monte Carlo scheme and show an acceleration by an order of magnitude in simulated annealing of the symmetric traveling salesman problem. We compare our implementation with the exchange Monte Carlo algorithm for the three-dimensional Ising spin glass. Our implementation can be seen as a step toward accelerating the stochastic sampling of generic systems with complex landscapes and long equilibration times.", "label": "dolly"}

We considered several magnetic configurations and concluded that the system under pressure has a tendency towards non-collinear spin alignment. From the analysis of the exchange parameters, it emerged that the iron - iron interactions are strongly dependent on the polarization of the pd atoms. To account for this effect, an extended Heisenberg model with biquadratic terms was built. The energy of the system was minimized, while the parameters were determined based on the results of the DFT calculations. From this, a candidate for a ground state of the compressed fepd alloy was identified, which can be seen as a pair of interpenetrating triple-Q phases.", "label": "dolly"}

{"text": "Important component of most signal processing procedures is computing the distance between signals in multi-party applications where these signals belong to different parties. The signals may themselves be private, and the parties to the computation may not be willing to expose them. Solutions proposed to the problem in the literature generally invoke homomorphic encryption schemes, secure multi-party computation, or other cryptographic methods which introduce significant computational complexity into the proceedings. Such methods often make complex computations requiring repeated computations unfeasible. Other solutions invoke third parties, making unrealistic assumptions about their trustworthiness. In this paper, we propose an alternate approach, also based on third party computation, but without assuming as much trust in the third party. The individual participants to the computation \"secure\" their data through a proposed secure hashing scheme with shared keys, prior to sharing it with the third party. The hashing ensures that the third party can not recover any information about the individual signals or their statistics, either from analysis of individual computations or their long-term aggregate patterns. We provide theoretical proof of these properties and empirical demonstration of the feasibility of the computation.

{"text": "For many geologic applications, isotope ratios of radioactive elements are measured in minerals that give the amount of time that has passed since a rock passed through its particular closure temperature. These are used in geochronologic and thermochronologic studies. Common methods include uranium-lead dating, potassium-argon dating, argon-argon dating, and uranium-thorium dating. These methods are used for a variety of applications. Dating of lava and volcanic ash layers found within a stratigraphic sequence can provide absolute age data for sedimentary rock units which do not contain radioactive isotopes and calibrate relative dating techniques. These methods can also be used to determine ages of pluton emplacement. Thermochemical techniques can be used to determine temperature profiles within the crust, the uplift of mountain ranges, and paleotopography.", "label": "dolly"}
{"text": "Kublai Khan’s early years were turbulent and his reign lacked stability. Ogedei’s grandson Kaidu refused to submit to Kublai and threatened the western frontier of Kublai’s domain. The hostile but weakened Song dynasty remained an obstacle in the south.  Kublai secured the northeast border by installing the hostage prince Wonjong as the ruler of Korea in 1259. He then added a tributary state to his domains and secured the Mongols’ hold over the Korean Peninsula. Kublai was also threatened by domestic unrest. Li Tan, the son-in-law of a powerful official, instigated a revolt against Mongol rule in 1262. Kublai, confident in his military strength, successfully quashed the revolt. He was concerned that his reliance on Chinese officials left him vulnerable to future revolts and defections to the Song. In order to ensure stability, he curbed the influence of Chinese advisers and cultivated relationships with the Mongols of the west. With this, Kublai strengthened his military and successfully subdued the Song.", "label": "dolly"}

{"text": "The Hawaiian Islands consist almost entirely of layered basaltic lava flows. The sedimentary sequences of the mid-continental United States and the Grand Canyon in the southwestern United States contain almost-undeformed stacks of sedimentary rocks that have remained in place since Cambrian time. Other areas are much more geologically complex. In the southwestern United States, sedimentary, volcanic, and intrusive rocks have been metamorphosed, faulted, foliated, and folded. Even older rocks, such as the Acasta gneiss of the Slave craton in northwestern Canada, the oldest known rock in the world have been metamorphosed to the point where their origin is undiscernable without laboratory analysis. In addition, these processes can occur in stages. In many places, the Grand Canyon in the southwestern United States being a very visible example, the lower rock units were metamorphosed and deformed, and then deformation ended and the upper, undeformed units were deposited. Although any amount of rock emplacement and rock deformation can occur, and they can occur any number of times, these concepts provide a guide to understanding the geological history of an area.", "label": "dolly"}

{"text": "Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease and sympathetic ophthalmia (SO) are types of cell-mediated autoimmune granulomatous uveitis. Although the two diseases share common clinical features, they have certain gender differences. VKH classically has been reported as more prevalent in females than males, but some studies in Japan and China have not found differences in gender prevalence. Male patients have a higher risk of chorioretinal degeneration, vitiligo, and worse prognosis. Conversely, the changing levels of estrogen/progesterone during pregnancy and the menstrual cycle as well as higher levels of transforming growth factor- show a protective role in females. Potential causes of female predilection for VKH are associated with HLA-DR and HLA-DQ alleles. SO, a bilateral granulomatous uveitis, occurs in the context of one eye after a penetrating injury due to trauma or surgery. In contrast to the female dominance in VKH, males are more frequently affected by SO due to a higher incidence of ocular injury, especially during wartime. However, no clinically different manifestations are revealed between males and females in SO secondary to either ocular trauma or surgery. No gender difference has been reported in postsurgical cases of SO. The potential causes of the gender difference may provide hints on future treatment and disease evaluation.", "label": "dolly"}

Phrased as a decision problem, it is the problem of deciding whether the input has a factor less than k. No efficient integer factorization algorithm is known, and this fact forms the basis of several modern cryptographic systems, such as the RSA algorithm. The integer factorization problem is in NP and in co-NP (and even in UP and co-UP). If the problem is NP-complete, the polynomial time hierarchy will collapse to its first level (i.e., NP will equal co-NP). The best known algorithm for integer factorization is the general number field sieve, which takes time O(e(64/9)1/3(n.log 2)1/3(log (n.log 2))2/3) to factor an n-bit integer.

{"text": "In humans, this response is activated by complement binding to antibodies that have attached to these microbes or the binding of complement proteins to carbohydrates on the surfaces of microbes. This recognition signal triggers a rapid killing response. The speed of the response is a result of signal amplification that occurs following sequential proteolytic activation of complement molecules, which are also proteases. After complement proteins initially bind to the microbe, they activate their protease activity, which in turn activates other complement proteases, and so on. This produces a catalytic cascade that amplifies the initial signal by controlled positive feedback. The cascade results in the production of peptides that attract immune cells, increase vascular permeability, and opsonize (coat) the surface of a pathogen, marking it for destruction. This deposition of complement can also kill cells directly by disrupting their plasma membrane.", "label": "dolly"}

{"text": "The dynamics of the vibrational modes of the amide-I unit in a 3D helical structure is described through a generalized Davydov model. The helix is modeled by three spine units linked through covalent bonds and are hydrogen bonded.

At low temperature, the interspine hopping constants also contribute to the three-dimensional nature of the tvbs. At biological temperature, the pairs of vibron are confined within a spine and exhibit the same features as the bound states within a one-dimensional model. The interplay between temperature and the 3D nature of the helix gives rise to a third bound state tvbs III. Finally, the occurrence of breather-like behavior of two-vibron bound states is discussed through simulation of the infrared pump-probe spectroscopic response.", "label": "dolly"}

{"text": "The unusually large NOAA Active Region 2192, observed in October 2014, was outstanding in its productivity of major two-ribbon flares without coronal mass ejections. On a large scale, a predominantly north-south oriented magnetic system of arcade fields served as a strong lateral confinement for a series of large two-ribbon flares originating from the core of the active region. The large initial separation of the flare ribbons, together with an almost absent growth in ribbon separation, suggests a confined reconnection site high up in the corona. Based on a detailed analysis of the confined X1.6 flare on October 22, we show how exceptional the flaring of this active region was. We provide evidence for repeated energy release, indicating that the same magnetic field structures were repeatedly involved in magnetic reconnection. We find that a large number of electrons was accelerated to non-thermal energies, revealing a steep power law spectrum, but that only a small fraction was accelerated to high energies. The total non-thermal energy in electrons derived (on the order of $10^{0}$J), is considerably higher than that in eruptive flares of class X1, and corresponds to about 10% of the excess magnetic energy present in the active region corona.", "label": "dolly"}

{"text": "The Quantum Effective Density (QED Trace Anomaly) is calculated at one loop level using the loop regularization method, which is based on four dimensional spacetime and preserves gauge symmetry and Poincaré symmetry in spite of the introduction of two mass scales, namely the ultraviolet (UV) cutoff and infrared (IR) cutoff.

This explicitly demonstrates that the loop regularization method is indeed a self-consistent regularization scheme applicable to the calculations not only for the chiral anomaly, but also for the trace anomaly, at least at one loop level. It is also seen that the consistency conditions, which relates the tensor-type and scalar-type irreducible loop integrals, are crucial for obtaining a consistent result.

{"text": "We study the effects of strong electron-electron interactions on the surface of cubic topological kondo insulators (such as SmB6 and YbB6). These materials generally support three copies of massless Dirac nodes on the surface, but only two of them are energetically degenerate and exhibit an energy offset relative to the third one. With a tunable chemical potential, when the surface states host electron and hole pockets of comparable size, strong interactions may drive this system into rotational symmetry breaking nematic and translational symmetric breaking excitonic spin- or charge- density-wave phases. Taking a realistic surface band structure into account, we analyze the associated Ginzburg-Landau theory and compute the mean field phase diagram. Beyond mean field theory, this system can be described by a two component isotropic Ashkin-Teller model at finite temperature, and we outline the phase diagram of this model. Our theory provides a possible explanation of recent measurements which detect a two-fold symmetric magnetoresistance and an upturn in surface resistivity with tunable gate voltage in SmB6.

{"text": "Gradient networks can be used to model the dominant structure of complex networks. Previous works have focused on random gradient networks. Here we study gradient networks that minimize jamming on substrate networks with scale-free and Erdős-Rényi structure. We introduce structural correlations and strongly reduce congestion occurring on the network by using a Monte Carlo optimization scheme. This optimization alters the degree distribution and other structural properties of the resulting gradient networks. These results are expected to be relevant for transport and other dynamical processes in real network systems. Complex networks have been shown to offer a powerful framework for the study of dynamical processes in complex systems. A fundamental question in this context is to identify how the structure of dominant connections influences the dynamical properties of the entire system. Gradient networks have been introduced in references precisely to characterize the structure governing transport in complex networks. Remarkably, similar structures have been identified recently in the optimization of synchronizability in oscillator networks. Here, we consider the problem of optimization of transport and show that by using a Monte Carlo approach congestion can be reduced in complex networks. We discuss the structural correlations that emerge with optimization and its implications for real systems.", "label": "dolly"}

In many species, females actively solicit or freely engage in EPCs. EPCs have been proposed to be a benefit for females, as they are likely to result in the genetic material of the extra-pair partner being passed on. Detailed behavioural studies show that females sometimes engage in EPCs with more dominant males, or with males with more elaborate ornaments. Paternity studies in species in which paternity was assigned showed that extra-pair young were divided asymmetrically between males.

{"text": "A job where there are many willing workers willing to work a large amount of time (high supply) competing for a job that few require (low demand) results in a low wage for the job. This is because competition among workers drives down the wage. An example of this would be jobs such as dish-washing or customer service. Competition amongst workers tends to drive down wages due to the expendable nature of the worker in relation to his or her particular job. A job where there are few able or willing workers (low supply), but a large need for the positions (high demand), will result in high wages for that job. This is because competition between employers for employees will drive up the wage. Examples of this would be jobs that require highly developed skills, rare abilities, or a high level of risk. Competition amongst employers tends to drive up wages due to the nature of the job, since there is a relative shortage of workers for the particular position. Professional and labor organizations may limit the supply of workers which results in higher demand and greater incomes for members. Members may also receive higher wages through collective bargaining, political influence, or corruption.", "label": "dolly"}

{"text": "The phenotypically diverse group of conditions characterized by calcium phosphate deposition in soft connective tissues such as pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) are referred to as \"heritable ectopic mineralization disorders\". They are also known as generalized arterial calcification of infancy (GACI), arterial calcification due to cd73 deficiency (ACDC) or mineralization defects. The prototype of such conditions is PXE, and similar conditions with overlapping clinical features include GACI and ACDC. Molecular genetic investigations have revealed mutations in genes involved in generation of inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi) and phosphate (Pi), and the findings suggest a unifying pathomechanism relating to reduced PPi/Pi ratio. This hypothesis is based on the notion that PPi serves as a powerful inhibitor of mineralization while Pi is a pro-mineralization factor, and an appropriate PPi/Pi ratio is critical for prevention of ectopic mineralization under homeostatic conditions. PXE International, the premier patient support organization advocating on behalf of patients and families with PXE, sponsors regular research meetings evaluating the progress in these ectopic mineralization disorders. The latest meetings were held in September 2014 in Bethesda, MD and September 2015 in Budapest, Hungary.

{"text": "We consider the full duplex two-way amplify-and-forward relay system with imperfect cancellation of loopback self-interference (si) and investigate joint design of relay and receive beamforming for minimizing the mean-squared-error (MSE) under a relay transmit power constraint. Due to loopback channel estimation error and the limitation of the analog-to-digital converter (ADC), the loopback si cannot be completely canceled. Multiple antennas at the relay can help loopback si suppression but beamforming is required to balance between the residual si suppression and the desired signal transmission. Moreover, the relay beamforming matrix should be updated every time slot because the residual si in the previous time slot is amplified by the current beamforming matrix and added to the received signals from the two sources in the current time slot. We derive the optimally balanced relay beamforming and receive beamforming matrices in closed form based on minimum mean-squared-error (MSE), taking into account the propagation of the residual loopback si from the first to the current time slot. We also propose beamforming design using only the channels of the latest time slots, not from the first time slot.

{"text": "The essential feature of weak measurements on quantum systems is the reduction of measurement back-action to negligible levels. To observe the non-classical features of weak measurements, it is therefore more important to avoid additional back-action errors than it is to avoid errors in the actual measurement outcome. In this paper, it is shown how an optical weak measurement of diagonal polarization can be realized by path interference between the horizontal and vertical polarization components of the input beam. The measurement strength can then be controlled by rotating the horizontal and vertical polarizations towards each other. This well-controlled operation effectively generates the back-action without additional decoherence, while the visibility of the interference between the two beams only limits the measurement resolution. As the experimental results confirm, we can obtain extremely high weak values even at rather low visibilities. Our method therefore provides a realization of weak measurements that is extremely robust against experimental imperfections.", "label": "dolly"}

Highland Council is responsible for providing officers to assess and assist local people suffering from mental illnesses, many of whom are incapacitated and have learning disabilities. The council's audit and scrutiny committee will hear that up to 32 people in the council have been waiting for about three-and-a-half years for an assessment. HUG says the delay could prove a real danger to vulnerable people, and warns the system is creaking at the seams. The group says they want urgent action to be taken. Highland Council claims that due to heavy workloads, their officers have had to prioritise cases, but that they are in regular contact with family representatives of those waiting for an assessment to ensure no one is at risk.

Two sources, WFI J132813.7+021437 and WFI J161953.3+031909, were subsequently shown to have unfortunate coincidences that led to their previous designation as transients.  While WFI J132813.7+021437 is now interpreted as the spatial coincidence of a solar system object with faint background star, WFI J161953.3+031909 is merely a cataclysmic variable caught in and out of eclipse.  The third candidate, RS Cnc, was identified as an SU Uma-type dwarf nova with quiescent brightness of @xmath1 and an outburst amplitude of @xmath2mag.  The fourth event, SDSS J160213.1+002131.7, similarly showed evidence for a dwarf nova origin.

{"text": "In the late 1980s, the Western Atlantic ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi was accidentally introduced into the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov via the ballast tanks of ships, and has been blamed for causing sharp drops in fish catches by eating both fish larvae and small crustaceans that would otherwise feed the adult fish. Mnemiopsis is well equipped to invade new territories, as it can breed very rapidly and tolerate a wide range of water temperatures and salinities. The impact was increased by chronic overfishing, and by eutrophication that gave the entire ecosystem a short-term boost, causing the Mnemiopsis population to increase even faster than normal – and above all by the absence of efficient predators on these introduced ctenophores. The impact was brought under control by the accidental introduction of the Mnemiopsis-eating North American ctenophore Beroe ovata, and by a cooling of the local climate from 1991 to 1993, which significantly slowed the animal's metabolism. However, the abundance of plankton in the area seems unlikely to be restored to pre-Mnemiopsis levels.", "label": "dolly"}

The possibility of a secondary infection due to contaminated corneal surface after cross-linking can occur. Additionally, formation of temporary haze, permanent scars, endothelial damage, failure, sterile infiltrates, and herpes reactivation can be seen.

In the case of QDs grown on a distributed Bragg reflector the photoluminescence intensity is enhanced by more than one order of magnitude, whereas the single QD lines are broadened. Structural and chemical analysis reveals an unintentional formation of a thin ZnSe layer induced by the growth interruption needed for the deposition of the QDs sheet. Sharp emission lines from individual quantum dots are recovered in the case of a thicker ZnTe layer grown prior to the QDs.

In 32 first-episode schizophrenia patients, volumetric measurements of the hippocampus, lateral ventricle, and the anterior limb of the internal capsule (ALIC) could be performed. The subgroups of first-episode schizophrenia with good and poor outcome, defined by a clinically relevant change of the PANSS score, were compared to each other with regard to these volumetric measures. Multivariate analysis of covariance revealed a significant reduction of the maximal cross-sectional area of the left ALIC in fe-sz with clinically relevant deterioration compared to those with stable psychopathology.

{"text": "By using a serotonin antibody and confocal microscopy, this study reports for the first time direct serotonergic innervation of the muscle sheath covering the secretory region of the salivary glands of adult tsetse fly, Glossina pallidipes austen. Up until this finding, however, note that dipteran species previously studied lack a muscle sheath covering of the secretory region of the salivary glands. Direct innervation of the salivary gland muscle sheath of tsetse would facilitate rapid deployment of saliva into the host, thus delaying a host response. Our results also show that the neuronal and abnormal pattern seen in viral infected glands by the Glossina pallidipes salivary gland hypertrophy virus ( gpsghv) is due to a compensatory increased branching of the neurons of the salivary glands, which is associated with the increased size of the salivary glands in viral infected flies. This study shows for the first time serotonin in the cell bodies of the brain and thoracico-abdominal ganglion in adult tsetse, Glossina pallidipes austen.

Furthermore, we also consider the interaction of an active filament with itself and the environment via self-contact, surface friction and hydrodynamics. We examine the accuracy of our energy-preserving and second-order spatio-temporal method by means of benchmark problems with known analytic solutions. Finally, we demonstrate the capabilities of our approach, both on passive physical problems related to solenoid and plectoneme formation in twisted, stretched filaments, and active biophysical problems in the context of limbless locomotion on solid surfaces and in bulk liquids. All together, our approach allows for a broad computational generalization of available methods for studying the dynamics of soft filaments.", "label": "dolly"}

By connecting two quantum dots to two sites of the data bus, the system can accomplish high-fidelity and long-distance quantum state transfer. Numerical simulations were performed for a finite system, which showed that the numerical and analytical results of the effective coupling strength agreed well with each other.

Here, we tested the hypothesis that the hexane fraction of American Ginseng can cause inflammatory cell apoptosis and suppress colitis through a p53 mechanism. We found that it only caused limited impact of p53 in the ability of the hexane fraction to induce inflammatory cell apoptosis and suppress colitis in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we asked whether the hexane fraction could cause cell cycle arrest of HCT116 colon cancer cells. Surprisingly, the hexane fraction caused a G1 arrest of HCT116 cells independent of p53 status. Findings are significant because American Ginseng suppresses colitis and associated colon cancer and mutations in p53 are observed in most colitis-driven colon cancers. Therefore, the hexane fraction might be very effective in targeting inflammatory cells and cancer cells since it can induce apoptosis of inflammatory cells and cell cycle arrest in both p53-mutated and wt p53 colon cancer cells.", "label": "dolly"}
{"text": "Computational detection of similarities between protein 3D structures has become an indispensable tool for the classification of protein families and functional inference. Consequently, numerous algorithms have been developed that facilitate structure comparison, including rapid searches against a steadily growing collection of protein structures. To this end, the “ncbi molecular modeling database (mmdb)” maintains a comprehensive and up-to-date archive of protein structure similarities computed with the vector alignment search tool (“vast”). These similarities have been recorded on the level of single proteins and protein domains, comprising in excess of 1.5 billion pairwise alignments. Here, we present “vast +”, an extension to the existing “vast” service, which summarizes and presents structural similarity on the level of biological assemblies or macromolecular complexes. Vast + simplifies structure neighboring results and shows, for macromolecular complexes tracked in mmdb, lists of similar complexes ranked by the extent of similarity. Vast + replaces the previous vast service as the default presentation of structure neighboring data in ncbi’s Entrez Query and Retrieval system. mmdb and vast + can be accessed via http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/structure/.", "label": "dolly"}

{"text": "We analyze the general radiation emission mechanism from a charged particle moving in a curved inhomogeneous magnetic field. The consideration of the gradient makes the curved vacuum magnetic field compatible with the maxwell equations and adds a non-trivial term to the transverse drift velocity and, consequently, to the general radiation spectrum. To obtain the radiation spectrum in the classical domain, a general expression for the spectral distribution and characteristic frequency of an electron in arbitrary motion is derived by using Schwinger's method. The radiation patterns of the ultrarelativistic electron are represented in terms of the acceleration of the particle. The same results can be obtained by considering that the motion of the electron can be formally described as an evolution due to magnetic and electric forces. By defining an effective electromagnetic field, which combines the magnetic field with the fictitious electric field associated to the curvature and drift motion, one can obtain all the physical characteristics of the radiation by replacing the constant magnetic field with the effective field. The power, angular distribution and spectral distribution of all three components (synchrotron, curvature and gradient) of the radiation are considered in both classical and quantum domains in the framework of this unified formalism. In the quantum domain, the proposed approach allows the study of the effects of the inhomogeneities and curvature of the magnetic field on the radiative transitions rates of electrons between low-lying Landau levels and the ground state.", "label": "dolly"}
{"text": "The purpose of this study was to examine the association between body mass index and the transitions between disability and mortality among older adults in Brazil. Longitudinal data from the Health, Well-Being and Aging in Latin America and the Caribbean (HELAC) study, conducted in 2000 and 2006 in So Paulo, Brazil, was used to examine the impact of obesity on these transitions, and of weight changes on health transitions related to disability. Logistic and multinomial regression models were used in the analyses. Individuals who were obese were more likely than those of normal weight to have limitations on ADLs, IADLs, and Nagi's limitations. Obesity was associated with higher incidence of ADL and Nagi's limitations and with lower recovery from Nagi's limitations. Compared to those who maintained their weight, those who gained weight experienced higher incidence of ADL and Nagi's limitations, even after controlling for initial body mass index. Higher mortality among overweight individuals was only found when the reference category was remaining free of Nagi limitations. The findings of the study underline the importance of maintaining normal weight for preventing disability at older ages.", "label": "dolly"}
{"text": "We present and analyze a pointed PSPC observation of the Seyfert galaxy NGC 4051. The X-ray spectrum consists of a powerlaw modified by absorption edges and an additional soft excess during the high state in source flux. Modeling the spectrum in terms of warm absorption yields a large column density of the ionized material of $22.7$ and an ionization parameter of 0.4. These properties are essentially constant throughout the observation, whereas the luminosity changes by more than a factor of 4. The underlying powerlaw is in its steepest observed state, with a photon index of 2.3. Information from optical observations suggests the presence of a separate euv bump component. The impact of several parameters on the deduced properties of the ionized material is critically assessed. In particular, the influence of dust mixed with the warm gas is explored and shown to constrain the history or density of the absorber. The absorber-intrinsic optical - uv emission (and absorption) line spectrum is predicted and the possibility of a warm absorber origin of one of the observed emission line regions in NGC 4051 is investigated. The consequences for the narrow-line Seyfert 1 character of NGC 4051 are discussed. \n                           _ _ _ _ _", "label": "dolly"}

Methods. A total of 90 pregnant women (age: 1933 years) were considered during 2012. Serum levels of adma, vegf, and nitrite were measured in maternal serum samples using ELISA kits. Results. Significant increases of vegf and nitrite levels were observed in preeclampsia patients when compared with other groups (p<0.05). The serum level of adma demonstrated a similar increase in preeclampsia patients; however, the increase was not statistically significant (p=0.08). Conclusion. The findings reveal that the elevation of serum levels of vegf and nitrite and possibly adma may be involved in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia.", "label": "dolly"}
{"text": "We investigate the thermoelectric properties and heat-to-work conversion performance of an interacting, multi-level quantum dot (qd). We focus on the sequential tunneling regime. We study the dynamics of charge in the qd by means of master equations for the probabilities of occupation. From here, we compute the charge and heat currents in the linear response regime assuming a generic multi-terminal setup, and for low temperatures (quantum limit). We obtain analytical expressions for the transport coefficients accounting for the interplay between interactions (charging energy) and level quantization. In the case of systems with two and three terminals, we derive formulas for the power factor and the figure of merit for a qd-based heat engine, identifying optimal working conditions which maximize output power and efficiency of heat-to-work conversion. Beyond the linear response, we study the thermoelectric non-linear coefficients assessing the consequences of large temperature and voltage biases. We then investigate the conditions which optimize the performance of a heat engine, finding that in the quantum limit, output power and efficiency at maximum power can almost be simultaneously maximized by choosing appropriate values of electrochemical potential and bias voltage. At last, we study how energy level degeneracy can increase the output power.", "label": "dolly"}
{"text": "This research finds that the cosmological parameters and dark energy can be constrained by combining different cosmological data sets such as type Ia supernovae, cosmic microwave background anisotropy, baryon acoustic oscillation, X-ray gas mass fraction, Sloan Digital Sky Survey and gamma-ray bursts. Recently, gamma-ray bursts are argued to be promising standard candles for cosmography. We present constraints on the cosmological parameters and dark energy by combining the latest grb sample including 69 events with the other cosmological probes. We first find that the most stringent constraint on the cosmological parameters and dark energy lies in the redshift range $0.5 < z < 1.3$ for a @xmath1cdm cosmology. This finding can be explained by fitting different dark energy models and finding them to be consistent with the @xmath1cdm cosmology. We also reconstruct the dark energy equation of state and the deceleration parameter. We find that the acceleration could have started at a redshift from $z=0.4$ to $z=0.6$. This difference in the transition redshift is due to different dark energy models that we adopt. Finally, we present constraints on several two parameter dark energy models and find that these models are consistent with the @xmath1cdm cosmology.", "label": "dolly"}

{"text": "Because of their universal nature, fano fluctuations are expected to influence the response of superconducting nanowire single photon detectors ( snspds ). We predict that the photon counting rate ( @xmath0 ) as a function of bias current ( @xmath1 ) in snspds is described by an integral over a transverse coordinate-dependent complementary error function. This describes smearing of local responses due to fano fluctuations of the amount of energy deposited into the electronic system. The finite width of @xmath0 vs @xmath1 arises from fluctuations in the energy partition between quasiparticles and phonons during the energy down-conversion cascade. In narrow-wire single photon detectors, the local responses are uniform, and the effect of fano fluctuations on @xmath2 is dominant. In wide-wire single photon detectors with strong coordinate dependence of local responses due to vortex-antivortex unbinding and vortex entry from edges, fano fluctuations smear singularities imprinted by vorticity on the transition part of @xmath0 curve. We demonstrate good agreement between theory and experiments for a series of bath temperatures and photon energies in narrow-wire wsi single photon detectors.

{"text": "The aim of the study was to assess the influence of two irrigation regimens, having ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and EDTA with cetrimide (CT), respectively, on the dentine wettability for AH Plus sealer by comparing its contact angle formed with the irrigated dentine. The study materials and methods were divided into two groups (n = 10), and the groups were irrigated with 3% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) solution followed by either 17% EDTA or 17% EDTA with CT solution as a final irrigant. AH Plus sealer was mixed, and controlled volume droplet (0.1 ml) of the sealer was placed on the dried samples. The contact angle was measured using a dynamic contact angle analyzer and results were analyzed using SPSS 21.0 and 2-sample t-test. The results showed a significant difference in the contact angle of AH Plus formed with the dentine irrigated with the above two regimens, with AH Plus showing significantly lower contact angle with the regimen having CT as a final irrigant than the one with EDTA. This result indicates that CT as a final irrigant facilitates better dentin wettability than EDTA for AH Plus to promote its better flow and adhesion.", "label": "dolly"}

Here we describe the intraoperative use of this technique in a single patient with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme (gbm). An 86-year-old female was admitted in the clinic with a 2-month history of slowly progressing left -sided paresis. Neuroimaging studies demonstrated an irregular space - occupying process consistent with a malignant glioma in the right fronto - temporo - insular region. An elective surgical intervention was performed by using 5-aminolevulinic acid fluorescence (blue 400, opmi) and intraoperative irt brain mapping (1.25 mrad ifov, 0.05c netd). After dura opening, the cerebral surface appeared inconspicuous. However, irt revealed a significantly colder area (t1.01c), well corresponding to the cortical epicenter of the lesion. The underlying tumor was partially excised and the histological result was gbm. Intraoperative irt seems to be a useful technique for subcortical convexity brain tumor localization. Further studies with a large number of patients are needed to prove the reliability of this method in gbm surgery.", "label": "dolly"}

{"text": "The antiferromagnetic ordering present in a two-dimensional Ising antiferromagnet has been a longstanding subject of study, and it was thought to be infinitely heavy due to the string of wrongly oriented spins it creates as it moves.  However, trugman demonstrated that the hole acquires a finite effective mass due to contributions from so-called trugman loop processes, where the hole goes nearly twice around closed loops, first creating and then removing wrongly-oriented spins, and ending up at a different lattice site.  This generates effective second and third nearest neighbor hopping terms, which keep the quasiparticle on the sublattice it was created on.  In this work, we investigate the trapping of the quasiparticle near a single attractive non-magnetic impurity placed at one lattice site.  We consider the two cases in which the quasiparticle and impurity are on the same or on different sublattices.  The main result is that, even though the quasiparticle cannot see the bare disorder in the latter case, the coupling to magnons generates an effective renormalized disorder on its own sublattice which is strong enough to lead to bound states, which however have a very different spectrum than when the quasiparticle and impurity are on the same sublattice.", "label": "dolly"}

{"text": "We study the potential of the CNGS beam to constrain the parameter space of a model with one sterile neutrino separated from three active ones by an MS2.  Our analysis is performed using Opera as a reference (our analysis can be upgraded including a detailed simulation of the IKAROS detector).  We point out that the channel with the largest potential to constrain the sterile neutrino parameter space at the CNGS is the CNGS-2 channel.  This is due to twofold reasons : first, the active-sterile mixing angle which governs this oscillation is the less constrained by present experiments; second, this is the signal for which both Opera and IKAROS have been designed, and thus benefits from an extremely low background.  In our analysis, we have also taken into account (1) oscillations.  We find that the potential of the CNGS to look for sterile neutrinos is limited with nominal intensity of the beam, but it is significantly enhanced with a factor of 2 to 10 increase in the neutrino flux.  Data from both channels allow us, in this case, to constrain further the four-neutrino model parameter space.  Our results hold for any value of MS2, _i.e. _ when oscillations driven by this mass-squared difference are averaged.  We have also checked that the bound on MS3 that can be put at the CNGS is not affected by the possible existence of sterile neutrinos.", "label": "dolly"}

{"text": "We consider the type I see - saw model with two right - handed neutrinos and a normal neutrino mass hierarchy and impose a zero coupling between the right - handed neutrino mainly responsible for the atmospheric neutrino mass and the electron neutrino. We derive a master formula which relates the see-saw input parameters in a one-to-one correspondence with physical neutrino observables. Using the master formula, we search for simple ratios of couplings consistent with current data on neutrino mass and lepton mixing. We discover a minimal predictive example in which the right - handed neutrino mainly responsible for the atmospheric neutrino mass has couplings to the electron neutrino proportional to the muon neutrino or tau neutrino, with a relative phase, providing the link between leptogenesis and CP violation in neutrino oscillation experiments. We show how these patterns of couplings could arise from an - family symmetry model of leptons which predicts all the pmns parameters in terms of the neutrino mass ratio, corresponding to tri - bimaximal - cabibbo mixing, accurate to one degree.", "label": "dolly"}

Wenda Carlisle: Their offences were relatively minor and non-custodial, but because of the publication restrictions under the Children's Criminal Proceedings Act in New South Wales, Background Briefing is not permitted to name the offences that these individuals committed. Ed Santow says the police response has been entirely out of proportion. Edward Santow: If you look at the lead applicant in our class action, the original offence that he was charged with was riding on a train without a ticket. Ultimately he was then detained for breach of bail associated with that original offence. Now, you are never going to be detained for any length of time for simply riding on the train without a ticket. Wendy Carlisle: For fare evasion. Edward Santow: Yes, exactly. So there's a complete lack of proportion between what the underlying offence was alleged to be and I guess the approach taken by the police in enforcing bail conditions. And that's what we think is totally out of whack. Wendy Carlisle: One such story is that of 13-year-old Reginald Simpson, an Aboriginal boy from Wagga Wagga in New South Wales. The recording you are about to hear is of Reginald Simpson being interviewed by his lawyers, and he has given his consent for it to be broadcast. In 2007 he went to visit his aunty in Cowra, and one night the police turned up looking for him and he hid under the bed. Police said he wasn't allowed to leave Wagga and that he had breached his bail. Reginald Simpson: All of a sudden there was a bang at the door and then my auntie let me know that the police were outside looking for me. They said I wasn't allowed to leave Wagga Wagga and they were detaining me. I couldn't believe it and I was so scared. It was the first time I'd ever experienced anything like that. Wendy Carlisle: Reginald Simpson eventually sued the police for the violation of his bail conditions and won his case in 2007. The police eventually apologised and said that this case was a terrible example of the kind of power and authority that police officers can exert over individuals in New South Wales.", "label": "dolly"}
{"text": "A particularly simple example of a probabilistic test is the Fermat primality test, which relies on the fact (Fermat's little theorem) that n p ≡ n (mod p) for any n if p is a prime number. If we have a number b that we want to test for primality, then we work out nb (mod b) for a random value of n as our test. A flaw with this test is that there are some composite numbers (the Carmichael numbers) that satisfy the Fermat identity even though they are not prime, so the test has no way of distinguishing between prime numbers and Carmichael numbers. Carmichael numbers are substantially rarer than prime numbers, though, so this test can be useful for practical purposes. More powerful extensions of the Fermat primality test, such as the Baillie-PSW, Miller-Rabin, and Solovay-Strassen tests, are guaranteed to fail at least some of the time when applied to a composite number.", "label": "dolly"}

{"text": "The common marmoset ( Callithrix jacchus) is increasingly being utilised as a non-human primate model for human disease, ranging from autoimmune to infectious disease. In order to fully exploit these models, meaningful comparison to the human host response is necessary. Commercially available reagents, primarily targeted to human cells, were utilised to assess the phenotype and activation status of key immune cell types and cytokines in naive and infected animals. Single cell suspensions of blood, spleen, and lung were examined. Generally, the phenotype of cells was comparable between humans and marmosets, with approximately 63% of all lymphocytes in the blood of marmosets being T cells, 25% B cells, and 12% NK cells. The percentage of neutrophils in marmoset blood were more similar to human values than mouse values. Comparison of the activation status of cells following experimental systemic or inhalational infection exhibited different trends in different tissues, most obvious in cell types active in the innate immune response. This work significantly enhances the ability to understand the immune response in these animals and fortifies their use as models of infectious disease.", "label": "dolly"}

Consequently, these figures can greatly alter the SSCP's projected sustainability. Second, cyclonic storms could significantly alter the planned deposition of dredged material.

{"text": "We demonstrate that graphene coatings can provide efficient protection from oxidation by blocking oxygen atoms from entering the underlying reactive surface, which would otherwise have penetrated from the top of the graphene layer. Graphene bilayer, which blocks the diffusion of oxygen with a higher energy barrier, provides even better protection from oxidation. Moreover, an oxygen molecule weakly bound to a bare graphene surface is inactive, while it can easily dissociate into two oxygen atoms adsorbed to low coordinated carbon atoms at the edges of a vacancy. For these oxygen atoms, the oxidation barrier is reduced, and hence the protection from oxidation provided by graphene coatings is weakened.

In the compound engine, high-pressure steam from the boiler expands in a high-pressure (HP) cylinder and then enters one or more subsequent lower-pressure (LP) cylinders. The complete expansion of the steam now occurs across multiple cylinders and as less expansion now occurs in each cylinder less heat is lost by the steam in each. This reduces the magnitude of cylinder heating and cooling, increasing the efficiency of the engine. To derive equal work from lower-pressure steam requires a larger cylinder volume as this steam occupies a greater volume. Therefore, the bore, and often the stroke, are increased in low-pressure cylinders resulting in larger cylinders. This method reduces the variability of torque and results in higher efficiency.", "label": "dolly"}

The exact grand-canonical solutions of the model are obtained considering that up to monomers can be placed on a site and associating a weight for a four-fold visited site. Rich phase diagrams are found, with non-polymerized ( np ), regular polymerized ( p ) and dense polymerized ( dp ) phases, separated by lines or surfaces of continuous and discontinuous transitions. For Bethe lattice with square and coordination Husimi lattices, the collapse transition is identified with a bicritical point and the collapsed phase is associated with the dense polymerized phase (solid-like) instead of the regular polymerized phase (liquid-like). A similar result is found for Husimi lattice with Bethe lattice, which may explain the difference between the collapse transition for isat and for interacting self-avoiding walks on the square lattice. For Bethe lattice with coordination 7 and coordination 8, a more complex phase diagram is found, with two critical planes and two coexistence surfaces, separated by two tricritical and two critical end-point lines meeting at a multicritical point. The mapping of the phase diagrams in the canonical ensemble is discussed and compared with simulational results for regular lattices.", "label": "dolly"}
{"text": "This movie took me by surprise. The opening credit sequence features beautifully animated scenes, which effectively introduces the characters and sets the tone for the movie. After that, we're plunged into a low-budget production, betraying its low budget. Characters, typical American teens, are introduced slowly, with more personal details than is usually found in movies like this. By the time the shlitz hits the fan, we know each of the characters, and either like or hate them according to their distinct personalities. The set-up is gradual, kind of like the ride up a really tall roller coaster. Luckily, once the action kicks in, it's full-blown horror, as opposed to the sullen tone of earlier genre fare like Night of the Living Dead or Hills Have Eyes. But for true horror fans, this one is worth checking out. Play it as the first entry on a double bill with the 1999 remake of House on the Haunted Hill.

{"text": "We study the role of dissipation and structural defects on the time evolution of quantum dot arrays with mobile charges under external driving fields. These structures, proposed as quantum dot cellular automata, exhibit interesting quantum dynamics that can be described using equations of motion for the density matrix. Using an open system approach, we study the role of asymmetries and the microscopic electron-phonon interaction on the general dynamical behavior of the charge distribution (polarization). We find that the system response to the driving field is improved at low temperatures (and/or weak phonon coupling) before deteriorating as temperature and asymmetry increase. In addition to the study of the time evolution of polarization, we explore the linear entropy of the system to gain further insights into the competition between coherent evolution and dissipative processes.", "label": "dolly"}

{"text": "To understand the role of local sublattice imbalance in low energy spectra of quantum antiferromagnets, we study the quantum nearest neighbor heisenberg antiferromagnet on the coordination 3 Cayley tree. We perform many-body calculations using an implementation of the density matrix renormalization group (dmrg) technique for generic tree graphs. We discover that the bond-centered Cayley tree has a quasi-degenerate set of low-lying tower of states and an anomalous singlet-triplet finite size gap scaling. For understanding the construction of the first excited state from the many-body ground state, we consider a wavefunction ansatz given by the single-mode approximation (sma), which yields a high overlap with the dmrg wavefunction. Observing the ground state entanglement spectrum leads us to a picture of the low energy degrees of freedom being giant spins arising out of sublattice imbalance, which helps us analytically understand the scaling of the finite size spin gap. The schwinger boson mean field theory has been generalized to non-uniform lattices and ground states have been found which are spatially inhomogeneous in the mean field parameters.", "label": "dolly"}
{"text": "We calculate Curie temperatures and study the stability of ferromagnetism in diluted magnetic materials, taking as a model for the exchange between magnetic impurities a damped Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction and a short range term representing the effects of superexchange. To properly include effects of spin and thermal fluctuations as well as geometric disorder, we solve the effective Heisenberg Hamiltonian by means of a recently developed semi-analytical approach. This approach, “self-consistent local random phase approximation” (SC-LRPA), is explained. We show that previous mean-field treatments, which have been widely used in the literature, largely overestimate both Curie temperatures and the stability of ferromagnetism as a function of carrier density. The discrepancy when compared to the current approach was that effects of frustration in RKKY oscillations had been underestimated by such simple mean-field theories. We argue that the use, as is frequent, of a weakly disordered RKKY interaction to model ferromagnetism in diluted III–V systems is inconsistent with the observation of ferromagnetism over a wide region of itinerant carrier densities. This may be puzzling when compared to the apparent success of calculations based on ab-initio estimates of the coupling; we propose a resolution to this issue by taking RKKY-like interactions between resonant states close to the Fermi level.", "label": "dolly"}

Judas Kiss boasts several wonderful actors, an interesting plot and intriguing twists, but its strange visual wanderings and chopping editing ruined what might have been a great crime drama.

Why else would he toss in a topless/alien/lesbian porno scene in the first two minutes (that little surprise certainly made me scramble for the remote since my kids were playing nearby!)? Did he purposely instruct his two distinguished English actors (Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson) to use such awful New Orleans accents?

The antiferromagnetic order fluctuates in orientation but not in magnitude, so that there is no long-range antiferromagnetism. The normal state is described as a fractionalized Fermi liquid (fl*), with electron-like quasiparticles coupled to the fractionalized excitations of the fluctuating antiferromagnet. The electronic quasiparticles reside near pockets of finite area centered away from the magnetic Brillouin zone boundary. The violation of the conventional Luttinger theorem is linked to a species doubling of these quasiparticles. We describe phenomenological theories of the pairing of these quasiparticles, and show that a large class of mean-field theories generically displays a nodal-anti-nodal dichotomy: the interplay of local antiferromagnetism and pairing leads to a small gap near the nodes of the pairing along the Brillouin zone diagonals, and a large gap in the anti-nodal region.", "label": "dolly"}

Results indicated that across all fieldwork sites and data sources, there was a low presence of older people, with women considerably less present than men in developing countries. There was variation across fieldwork sites in older people’s presence by place and time of day and in their accompanied status. The presence of older people in images drawn from newspapers was associated with the news/non-news nature of the source. The utility of the study’s methodological approach is considered as is the degree to which the presence of older people in public fora might relate to social integration and inclusion in different cultural contexts.", "label": "dolly"}

{"text": "In the modern industrialized world, construction usually involves the translation of designs into reality. A formal design team may be assembled to plan the physical proceedings, and to integrate those proceedings with the other parts. The design usually consists of drawings and specifications, usually prepared by a design team including Architect, civil engineers, mechanical engineers, electrical engineers, structural engineers, fire protection engineers, planning consultants, architectural consultants, archaeological consultants, and a quantity surveyor. The design team is most commonly employed by the property owner. Under this system, once the design is completed by the design team, various construction companies may then be asked to make a bid for the work, either based directly on the design, or on the basis of drawings and a bill of quantities provided by a quantity surveyor. Following evaluation of bids, the owner typically awards a contract to the most cost efficient bidder.", "label": "dolly"}
{"text": "This paper looks into our growing understanding of the physics behind coronal heating (in open-field regions) and the acceleration of the solar wind. Many new insights have come from the last solar cycle's worth of observations and theoretical work. Measurements of the plasma properties in the extended corona, where the primary solar wind acceleration occurs, have been key to discriminating between competing theories. We describe how UVCs/SoHO observations of coronal holes and streamers over the last 14 years have provided clues about the detailed kinetic processes that energize both fast and slow wind regions. We also present a brief survey of current ideas involving the coronal sources of fast and slow wind streams and how these change over the solar cycle. These sources are discussed in the context of recent theoretical models (based on Alfvén waves and MHD turbulence) that have begun to successfully predict both the heating and acceleration in fast and slow wind regions with essentially no free parameters. Some new results regarding these models, including a quantitative prediction of the lower density and temperature at 1 au seen during the present solar minimum compared to the prior minimum, are also shown.", "label": "dolly"}

{"text": "The number of recent results from x ray observations of active galactic nuclei involving the Fe line (reduction of line variability compared to x ray continuum variability, the x ray \"baldwin effect\") were attributed to the presence of a hot, ionized skin of an accretion disc, suppressing emission of the line. The ionized skin appears as a result of the thermal instability of x ray irradiated plasma. We test this hypothesis by computing the Thomson thickness of the hot skin on top of the Shakura-Sunyaev disc, by simultaneously solving the vertical structure of both the hot skin and the disc. We then compute a number of relations between observable quantities, e.g. the hard x ray flux, amplitude of the observed reprocessed component, relativistic smearing of the line, the rms variability of the hard x rays. These relations can be compared to present and future observations. We point out that this mechanism is unlikely to explain the behaviour of the x ray source in MCG 6-30-15, where there are a number of arguments against the existence of a thick hot skin, but it can work for some other Seyfert 1 galaxies.

A 1996 study by Perotti examined the channels through which inequality can affect economic growth. He showed that, in accordance with the credit market imperfection approach, inequality is associated with lower levels of human capital formation (education, experience, and apprenticeship) and higher levels of fertility, and therefore lower levels of growth. He found that inequality is associated with higher levels of redistributive taxation, which is associated with lower levels of growth from reductions in private savings and investment. Perotti concluded that, \"more equal societies have lower fertility rates and higher rates of investment in education. Both are reflected in higher rates of growth.

Surface electromyography data were collected bilaterally from the lumbar iliocostalis and lumbar multifidus muscles during prone, quadruped and sitting exercises. Two-way ANOVA analysis showed that prone extension, and prone alternate arm and leg lifting exercises produced significantly greater activity in the lumbar iliocostalis than other exercises. Quadruped alternate arm and leg lifting exercises produced greater activity in the lumbar multifidus muscle than sitting exercises. Prone exercises generated the highest muscle activity, and may be the most effective exercises for strengthening both lumbar iliocostalis and lumbar multifidus muscles.

{"text": "The number of recent results from x-ray observations of active galactic nuclei involving the Fe line (reduction of line variability compared to x-ray continuum variability, the X-ray \"baldwin effect\") were attributed to a presence of a hot, ionized skin of an accretion disc, suppressing emission of the line. Ionized skin appears as a result of the thermal instability of x-ray irradiated plasma. We test this hypothesis by computing the Thomson thickness of the hot skin on top of the Shakura-Sunyaev disc, by simultaneously solving the vertical structure of both the hot skin and the disc. We then compute a number of relations between observable quantities, such as hard x-ray flux, amplitude of the observed reprocessed component, relativistic smearing of the line, the r.m.s. variability of the hard x-rays. These relations can be compared to present and future observations. We point out that this mechanism is unlikely to explain the behaviour of the x-ray source in MCG-6-30-15, where there are arguments against the existence of a thick hot skin, but it can work for some other Seyfert 1 galaxies.

Under the terms of the affiliation, the schools were required to have courses of study comparable to those at the university, to notify the university early of any contemplated faculty appointments or dismissals, to make no faculty appointment without the university's approval, and to send copies of examinations for suggestions. The University of Chicago agreed to confer a degree on any graduating senior from an affiliated school who made a grade of A for all four years, and on any other graduate who took twelve weeks additional study at the University of Chicago. A student or faculty member of an affiliated school was entitled to free tuition at the University of Chicago, and Chicago students were eligible to attend an affiliated school on the same terms and receive credit for their work.

{"text": "The rewritten paragraph uses creative vocabulary and concise language to explain the oscillation properties of relativistic, non-self-gravitating tori orbiting around black holes. The paper presents an analysis of the acoustic and epicyclic oscillations of vertically integrated tori in a Kerr spacetime. The paper extends the previous work in a Schwarzschild background. The tori are modeled with various non-keplerian distributions of specific angular momentum, and the oscillation properties are discussed. In parallel, a local analysis is presented which highlights the relations between acoustic and epicyclic oscillations in a Kerr background. A global eigenmode analysis is then performed to compute the axisymmetric modes, with results akin to what was found in a Schwarzschild background. For constant distributions of specific angular momentum, the eigenfrequencies appear in a sequence of 2:3:4 :... which is essentially independent of the size of the disc and of the black hole rotation. For non-constant distributions of angular momentum, on the other hand, the sequence is modified by the properties of the disc and the spin of the black hole, becoming harmonic for sufficiently large tori. The paper also discusses how the @xmath0 modes could explain the high frequency quasi-periodic oscillations observed in low-mass X-ray binaries and the properties of an equivalent model in Newtonian physics. \n                        The rewritten paragraph contains a more efficient vocabulary, more concise language, and an increased scientific understanding of the original paragraph.

These geometrical models implied a certain range of distance. Ptolemy’s most quoted model in fact predicted that the moon was nearly twice as far away at apogee than at perigee. Measuring the angular size of the moon was within the capabilities of pre-telescopic astronomers. These could have helped refine the models of the moon’s motion, but hardly anyone seems to have made any measurements that have come down to us. Using a piece of cardboard with a small hole punched in it which slides up and down a yardstick, we can determine an approximate value of the eccentricity of the moon’s orbit.

It guarantees some funny situations and silly antics, from especially Stan Laurel of course as usual. The movie also has a subplot with a nutty professor who is working on a rejuvenation formula. It doesn't really sound like a logical mix of story lines and incoherent but both plot lines blend in perfectly toward the memorable ending. It's still a bit weird but its funny nevertheless, so it works for the movie. The supporting cast of the movie is surprising good. Sam Adams is great as the stereotypical butler and Lucien Littlefield goes deliciously over-the-top as the nutty professor. The movie is filled with some excellent timed and hilarious constructed sequences, which are all quite predictable but become hilarious to watch nevertheless thanks to the way they are all executed. It all helps to make \"Dirty Work\" to be one of the better Laurel & Hardy shorts.", "label": "dolly"}

This editorial and the referenced articles of the Chinese Journal of Cancer discuss the complex political, economic, scientific, and technological issues surrounding air pollution. Do air pollution and its associated cancers warrant concern? Should air pollution be considered a necessary evil accompanying economic transformation in developing countries? Is an explosion of cancer incidence coming to China and how soon will it arrive? What must be done to prevent this possible human catastrophe? What approaches are taken to control air pollution?

Regardless of the reason you are here, whether you want to learn to fight like Inigo Montoya or Errol Flynn, gain physical and mental fitness, try a sport that challenges your body and mind, or just because you thought it looked cool and wanted to check if you could do it, you have come to the right place. We're not going to lie to you, becoming really good at fencing is not easy. We will ask you to do things that might seem awkward, redundant, and even a bit strange. And you will sweat and your body and arms will get tired and you'll probably get poked harder than you want from time to time, but it's all part of the game. Fencing will challenge you physically and mentally. Sometimes you might feel like you don't have it in you and the next time you fence it will all make sense. Feelings of self-doubt, the challenge to always improve, and the feeling that there is always something new to learn, an attack, defense, or new way to out-touch your opponent. All this will keep you coming back for more. Being a good fencer means being patient. And the first lesson in patience is to give yourself time to learn enough basics to have fun fencing.

Its detection of non-thermal radio, hard x-rays and gamma rays reveals the fact that it is able to accelerate particles up to very high energies. In order to explain the electromagnetic emission from Cygnus X-1 in the low-hard state, we present a model of a black hole corona with both lepton and hadron content. We characterize the corona as a two temperature hot plasma, plus a mixed non-thermal population where energetic particles interact with magnetic, photon and matter fields.

{"text": "The hierarchical Schur complement method (hsc) and its extension, have been shown to be a viable and efficient tool for evaluating the retarded Green's function of two-dimensional nanoscale devices. In this work, the hsc-extension is applied to evaluate the solution of non-equilibrium Green's functions of three-dimensional nanoscale devices. This operation count is analyzed for a cubic device. When a cubic device is discretized with a grid of points, the state-of-the-art recursive Green's function (rgf) algorithm requires one iteration, while the hsc-extension only requires two. Operation counts and runtime speeds-up over rgf are also studied for devices of practical interest: graphene-boron nitride-graphene multilayers, silicon nanowires, and a DNA molecule. The numerical experiments show that the cost for the hsc-extension is proportional to one LU-factorization and that the runtime speed-ups over rgf exceed three orders of magnitude when simulating realistic devices, such as a graphene-boron nitride-graphene multilayer with 40,000 atoms.", "label": "dolly"}

{"text": "We propose an algorithm for the efficient parallel implementation of elastoplastic problems with hardening based on the so-called t-finite element tearing and interconnecting (tfeti) domain decomposition method.  We consider an associated elastoplastic model with the von-Mises plastic criterion and the linear isotropic hardening law.  Such a model is discretized by the implicit euler method in time and the consequent one time step elastoplastic problem by the finite element method in space.  The latter results in a system of nonlinear equations with a strongly semismooth and strongly monotone operator.  The semismooth newton method is applied to solve this nonlinear system.  Corresponding linearized problems arising in the newton iterations are solved in parallel by the tfeti domain decomposition method.  The proposed tfeti based algorithm was implemented in MATLAB parallel environment and its performance was illustrated on a 3D elastoplastic benchmark.  Numerical results for different time discretizations and mesh levels are presented and discussed and a local quadratic convergence of the semismooth newton method is observed.", "label": "dolly"}

{"text": "This paper presents a synthetic statistical top - down mimo power line communications channel model based on a pure phenomenological approach. The basic idea consists of directly synthesizing the experimental channel statistical properties to obtain an extremely compact model that requires a small set of parameters. The model is derived from the analysis of the in-home @xmath0 mimo plc channel data set obtained by the etsi specialist task force 410 measurement campaign in the band 1.8100 MHz. The challenge of modeling the channel statistical correlation, exhibited among the frequencies and between the mimo modes, in compact form is tackled. It is shown that a small set of parameters can be used to reconstruct such a correlation behavior. The model is validated and compared to the measured channels, showing a good agreement in terms of average channel gain, root mean square delay spread, coherence bandwidth, and channel capacity distribution.

This is reflected in the derived SFR which implies continuous formation of Pop III stars, with the result that the SFR is high enough to support ionizing radiation from Pop III objects. Utilizing the derived SFR for Pop III objects, we can estimate the ultraviolet (UV) photon emission rate, in a certain redshift range where no observational data has been obtained on the intensity of ionizing radiation. We find that the Uv emissivity at that redshift range can make a noticeable contribution to the early reionization. The maximal emissivity is higher than the level required to keep ionizing the intergalactic matter. However, if the escape fraction of ionizing photons from Pop III objects is smaller than 10%, the IGM will be neutralized at some redshift. As for the enrichment, the ejection of all metals synthesized by Pop III objects is marginally consistent with the ionized metal fraction, though confinement of metals in Pop III objects can reduce the enrichment significantly.", "label": "dolly"}

From this model, we conclude that after the first year of publishing, nearly 11% of shared resources will be lost and after that, we will continue to lose 0.02% per day.

{"text": "Patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and diabetes mellitus, as well as patients admitted with elevated blood glucose without known diabetes, have impaired outcome. Therefore, intensive glucose-lowering therapy with insulin has been proposed in diabetic or hyperglycaemic patients and has been shown to improve survival and reduce incidence of adverse events. The current manuscript provides an overview of randomised controlled trials investigating the effect of intensive insulin therapy. Furthermore, systemic glucose-insulin-potassium infusion (GIK) has been studied to improve outcome after AMI. Despite positive findings in some early studies, GIK did not show any beneficial effects in recent clinical trials and thus this concept has been abandoned. While intensive insulin therapy targets to achieve normoglycaemia, it has been shown to improve outcome in patients with AMI. Achieving glucose regulation, however, is difficult and carries the risk of hypoglycaemia. More research is needed to determine the optimal glucose target levels in AMI and to investigate whether computerised glucose protocols and continuous glucose sensors can improve safety and efficacy of insulin.", "label": "dolly"}
{"text": "A prime number is a natural number that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. A natural number greater than 1 that is not a prime is called a composite number. For example, 5 is prime because 1 and 5 are its only positive integer factors, whereas 6 is composite because it has the divisors 2 and 3 in addition to 1 and 6. The fundamental theorem of arithmetic establishes the central role of primes in number theory: any integer greater than 1 can be expressed as a product of primes that is unique up to ordering. The uniqueness in this theorem requires excluding 1 as a prime because one can include arbitrarily many instances of 1 in any factorization, e.g., 3, 1 · 3, 1 · 1 · 3, etc. are all valid factorizations of 3.", "label": "dolly"}

{"text": "For a precise definition of what it means to solve a problem using a given amount of time and space, a computational model such as the deterministic Turing machine is used. The time required by a deterministic Turing machine M on input x is the total number of state transitions, or steps, the machine makes before it halts and outputs the answer (\"yes\" or \"no\"). A Turing machine M is said to operate within time f(n), if the time required by M on each input of length n is at most f(n). A decision problem A can be solved in time f(n) if there exists a Turing machine operating in time f(n) that solves the problem. Since complexity theory is interested in classifying problems based on their difficulty, one defines sets of problems based on some criteria. For instance, the set of problems solvable within time f(n) on a deterministic Turing machine is then denoted by DTIME(f(n)).", "label": "dolly"}

{"text": "Although @xcite is extremely useful in understanding the shapes of transmission spectra of exoplanets, it does not include the effects of a sharp change in flux with altitude due to surfaces and optically thick clouds.  Recent advances in understanding the effects of refraction in exoplanet transmission spectra have demonstrated that even clear thick atmospheres have a sharp change in flux due to refractive boundaries.  We have derived an analytical formalism by including first-order effects from all these surfaces to compute an exoplanet's effective radius, atmospheric thickness, and spectral modulation for a homogeneous atmosphere with a constant scale height.  We show that the effective radius cannot be located below these surfaces, and our formalism matches @xcite's in the case of a clear atmosphere.  Our formalism explains why clouds and refraction reduce the contrast of spectral features, and why refraction decreases the Rayleigh scattering slope as wavelength increases, but also shows that these are common effects of all surfaces.  We introduce the concept of a surface \"cross-section\", the minimum mean cross-section that can be observed, as an index to characterize the location of surfaces, and provide a simple method to estimate their effects on the spectral modulation of homogeneous atmospheres.  We devise a numerical recipe to extend our formalism to atmospheres with a non-constant scale height and arbitrary sources of opacity, which potentially will be necessary to interpret observations.", "label": "dolly"}

Sniffer dogs used to search students at the university, but nothing was found. The university says it wants to send a clear message that it is tightening checks. There will be regular police patrols on campus and the university is taking action to prevent drug use. Sir Anthony Seldon has been a high-profile campaigner for universities to take more responsibility for the well-being of students. He has argued that too many universities have neglected the well-being of young people who are leaving home for the first time. This, he says, has contributed to students having mental health problems. Buckingham has a project to become a \"positive health university\" and to challenge what Sir Anthony calls a \"crisis of mental health in our universities\". He wants university staff to take a more active role in supporting students and to intervene at an early stage if there are any emotional issues. The well-being project seeks to promote a healthier campus culture and to cultivate \"mental health literacy\" and \"emotional resilience\".

{"text": "Cardiac cachexia is a co-morbidity that may develop in terminal stages of chronic heart failure, affecting up to 15% of ambulatory patients with heart failure. Over the last decades, cardiac cachexia and alterations in muscle metabolism in heart disease have received increasing research interest. This article highlights some recent studies of cardiac cachexia that were presented at the annual meeting of the European Society of Cardiology in September 2010 in Stockholm, Sweden. Studies presented here were focused on effects of exercise training and protein degradation, particularly into the role of the ubiquitin proteasome complex and its ubiquitin ligases Murf-1 and Mafbx. Exercise training in patients with CHF was found to increase maximal oxygen consumption and to reduce Murf-1 expression. Lysosomal muscle degradation does not seem to play a major role in patients with CHF, however, inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-a seem to trigger muscle protein degradation. Other studies found that the serum levels of the adipokine adiponectin are elevated in patients with CHF and that these levels may be correlated with muscle mass, muscle strength in the arms or with trunk fat mass. Another study found that the expression of myostatin in skeletal muscle is decreased in spontaneously hypertensive rats with CHF compared with control animals. This is also true for follistatin, a powerful antagonist, and its potential as a biomarker of muscle wasting. These findings may pave the way for effective treatment approaches to cardiac cachexia.", "label": "dolly"}

{"text": "We research the possibility of tuning the electrostatic coupling between solid state quantum dots as building blocks for quantum bits. Specifically, our analysis is based on 2D electron systems (2deg) and depletion by top gates. We are interested in whether the Coulomb interaction between qubits can be tuned by electrical means through screening effects. The systems under investigation are modeled numerically by solving the Poisson equation in 3D via relaxation techniques with optimized algorithms for an extended set of boundary conditions. These include an open outer boundary, simulation of 2deg systems and dielectric boundaries like the surface of a physical sample. The results show that for currently lithographically available feature sizes, the coulomb interaction between the quantum bits is weak in general due to efficient screening in the planar geometry of 2deg and top gates. An effective tunability on the order of @xmath0 is clearly realizable while maintaining an intact quantum bit structure.", "label": "dolly"}

Based on this framework, a model of stochastic power price is formulated and solved by dynamic programming. A simpler myopic approach is proposed by comparing the cost of communication and the penalty incurred by using the old value of power price. A numerical simulation is conducted to compare the performance of the optimal strategy of price inquiry, as well as the near-optimality of the myopic approach.", "label": "dolly"}

The solution is based on the statistical interactions of vacancy particles in the lattice. Two different sets of vacancy particles are considered. In one set, all vacancies are of one - cell size and in the other set, vacancy particles are chosen according to the distance between atoms. Explicit expressions are derived for the Gibbs free energy and the distribution of spaces between atoms. Applications to various types of interaction potentials are discussed, including long - range potentials that give rise to phase transitions. Hard rod systems are straightforwardly extended to cases which involve lattice gases and their continuum limits.

{"text": "Background: timely diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) refers to a diagnosis at the stage when patients come to the attention of clinicians due to concerns about changes in cognition, behavior, or functioning and can be still free of dementia and functionally independent. Objectives: to comprehensively review existing scientific evidence on the benefits and potential challenges of making a timely diagnosis of AD. Methods: relevant studies were identified by searching electronic databases (Medline, Embase) and bibliographies for studies published in English between January 2000 and June 2014 on the consequences of a timely diagnosis of AD. Results: Nine studies were identified that investigated the consequences of diagnosing AD at the initial stages. None were specifically focused on prodromal AD. A timely diagnosis potentially offers the opportunities of early intervention, implementation of coordinated care plans, better management of symptoms, patient safety, cost savings, and postponement of institutionalization. Barriers to making a timely diagnosis include stigma, suicide risk, lack of training, diagnostic uncertainty, shortage of specialized diagnostic services, and the reluctance of healthcare providers to make a diagnosis when no effective disease-modifying options are available. Conclusions: despite its potential benefits, few published studies have explored the advantages or risks of a timely diagnosis of AD. In light of the cultural shift towards diagnosis at the initial stage of the disease continuum, when the patient does not yet have dementia, more investigations are needed to evaluate the benefits and address the barriers that may impede making a timely AD diagnosis.", "label": "dolly"}

{"text": "The precise origin of short gamma ray bursts (SGRBs) remains an important open question in relativistic astrophysics. Increasingly, observational evidence suggests the merger of a binary neutron star system as the source for most SGRBs. However, it is currently unclear how to distinguish observationally between a binary neutron star progenitor and a black hole-neutron star progenitor. We suggest the quasiperiodic signal of jet precession as an observational signature of SGRBs originating in mixed binary systems, and quantify both the fraction of mixed binaries capable of producing SGRBs and the distributions of precession amplitudes and periods. The difficulty inherent in disrupting a neutron star outside the horizon of a stellar mass black hole (bh) biases the jet precession signal towards low amplitude and high frequency. Precession periods of $x=0$ and disk-bh spin misalignment of $x=1$ are generally expected, although sufficiently high viscosity may prevent the accumulation of multiple precession periods during the SGRB. The precessing jet will naturally cover a larger solid angle in the sky than would standard SGRB jets, enhancing observability for both prompt emission and optical afterglows.", "label": "dolly"}

In the present paper, we supposed the basic straight part of agn jet, and used the data of axisymmetric simulation. The frm distribution we derived has a general tendency to have gradient across the jet axis, which is due to the toroidal component of the helical magnetic field generated by the rotation of the accretion disk. This kind of gradient in the frm distribution is actually observed in some agn jets (e.g. asada et al. 2002), which suggests helical magnetic field around the jets and thus supports our mhd model.

{"text": "In higher Landau levels, the ground state of the two-dimensional electron gas in a strong perpendicular magnetic field evolves from a Wigner crystal for small filling to a succession of bubble states with increasing number of guiding centers per bubble as the Landau level filling increases, to a modulated stripe state near half filling. In this work, we compute the frequency-dependent longitudinal conductivity of the Wigner and bubble crystal states in the presence of disorder. We apply an elastic theory to the crystal states which is characterized by a shear and a bulk modulus. We obtain both moduli from the microscopic time-dependent Hartree-Fock approximation. We then use the replica and Gaussian variational methods to handle the effects of disorder. Within the semiclassical approximation, we get the dynamical conductivity and the pinning frequency as functions of the Landau level filling factor and compare our results with recent microwave experiments.", "label": "dolly"}

Our goal is to explore the phase diagram and define the various phases and the critical boundary lines. Three phases appear: two of them are continuations of the strong and weak coupling phases of pure four-dimensional SU(2) to non-zero coupling, while the third phase is a five-dimensional Coulomb phase. We provide evidence that the transition between the five-dimensional Coulomb phase and the weak coupling phase is a second-order phase transition. Assuming that this result is not altered when increasing the lattice volume, we give a first estimate of the associated critical exponents.

Such models are asymptotically Friedmann in their past and evolve fluctuations in the energy density at later times. Second, we consider so-called quasi-static models. This class includes models that undergo self-similar gravitational collapse and is important for studying the formation of naked singularities. If naked singularities do form, they have profound implications for the predictability of general relativity as a theory.

{"text": "Serotonin ( 5-HT ) induces concentration-dependent metabolic effects in diverse cell types, including neurons, enterochromaffin cells, adipocytes, pancreatic beta cells, fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells, epithelial cells, and leukocytes. Three classes of genes regulating 5-HT function are constitutively expressed or induced in these cells: (a) membrane proteins that regulate the response to 5-HT, such as sert and 5HT-3 receptors, and (b) downstream signaling transduction proteins, and (c) enzymes controlling 5-HT metabolism, such as indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) and monoamine oxidase (MAO), which can generate biologically active catabolites, such as melatonin, kynurenines, and kynurenamines. This review covers the clinical and experimental mechanisms involved in 5-HT - induced immunomodulation. These mechanisms are cell-specific and depend on the expression of serotonergic components in immune cells. Consequently, 5-HT can modulate several immunological events, such as chemotaxis, leukocyte activation, proliferation, cytokine secretion, anergy, and apoptosis. The effects of 5-HT on immune cells may be relevant in the clinical outcome of pathologies with an inflammatory component, such as major depression, fibromyalgia, Alzheimer’s disease, psoriasis, arthritis, allergies, and asthma. Therefore, pharmacological regulation of the serotonergic system may modulate immune function and provide therapeutic alternatives for these diseases.", "label": "dolly"}

He has a remarkable charisma that captivates the audience with his performance. Jessica Lange is excellent as his wife Mary, while Tim Roth portrays the evil Cunningham and is perfect, in one way or another, you can tell he's disgusting. The Scotland scenery is beautiful, and the environment and conditions of the times are depicted quite well. If you like history, romance, passion and love, you'll enjoy Rob Roy. There's violence and blood, but it's unavoidable in telling this story as it should be told. No one actor or actress is glorified, they just look dirty in various scenes and use their skills to grab your attention. It's their talent as actors that keeps you watching, and it's not just talent that draws you to their characters but also their acting ability.", "label": "dolly"}
{"text": "Since April 2014, there are 88 private schools in New Zealand, catering for around 3.7% of the entire student population. Private schools have been in decline due to financial issues stemming from the increase in student numbers and the economy. In order to maintain their private school special character and receive state funding, private schools have had to become state-integrated schools. Integration into the state system means they must teach the state curriculum, employ registered teachers, and are unable to charge tuition fees. The most significant decline in private schools happened between 1979 and 1984 as Catholic schools integrated into the state system, leaving private schools mainly restricted to cities such as Auckland, Hamilton, Wellington and Christchurch.", "label": "dolly"}

{"text": "The Horava-Lifshitz (HL) theory has recently attracted a lot of interest as a viable solution to some quantum gravity related problems and the presence of an effective cosmological constant able to drive the cosmic speed up. We show here that in the weak field limit, the HL proposal leads to a modification of the gravitational potential, because of two additive terms (scaling respectively as and ) to the Newtonian potential. We then derive a general expression to compute the rotation curve of an extended system under the assumption that the mass density only depends on the cylindrical coordinates, showing that the HL modification induces a dependence of the circular velocity on the mass function, which is a new feature of the theory. As a first exploratory analysis, we then try fitting the Milky Way rotation curve using its visible components only, showing that the HL modified potential can not be an alternative to the dark matter framework. The amount of dark matter and the dark halo density profile have to be revised according to the new HL potential. Gravitation, dark matter and the galaxy: kinematics and dynamics.", "label": "dolly"}

Patients with symptomatic uterine fibroids (n=157) were treated with bilateral UAE using 350500 micron sized polyvinyl alcohol particles. The success rate of bilateral UAE was 96.8% and baseline measures of clinical symptoms and MRI taken before the procedure were compared to those taken 3, 6, and 12 months after embolotherapy. Furthermore, complications and outcomes were analyzed after procedure. All patients had an uneventful recovery and were able to return to normal activity within two weeks of embolization. After the procedure, most patients experienced crampy pelvic pain, of variable intensity, which was well managed with standard analgesia protocol. Five (3%) of participants had persisting amenorrhea after procedure and none reported any new gynecologic or medical problem during the follow-up period. There were no deaths and no major permanent injuries. Reductions in mean uterine volume were 61% (p < 0.01) and in dominant fibroid volume 66% (p < 0.01). The follow-up showed significant improvement in bleeding and significant reduction in pain. In conclusion, UAE is a successful, minimally invasive treatment of uterine fibroids which preserves the uterus, has minimal complications, and requires short hospitalization and recovery.", "label": "dolly"}
{"text": "Although a discovery of wimps either at colliders or in direct experiments would have enormous implications for our understanding of particle physics, it would imply less than one would like about our understanding of the dark matter in the universe or in the galactic halo.  It surely is possible that the discovered particles account for only a little of the total dark matter.  To establish the cosmological significance of a wimp discovery, their density must be determined.  We show that data from neither hadron colliders nor direct detection experiments alone can be sufficient to determine the local or relic density of discovered wimps, even allowing all needed assumptions about cosmology and astrophysics.  We provide examples of dark matter models where nearly identical detector or collider signals correspond to very different densities.

{"text": "To classify the computation time (or similar resources, such as space consumption), one is interested in proving upper and lower bounds on the minimum amount of time required by the most efficient algorithm solving a given problem. The complexity of an algorithm is usually taken to be its worst-case complexity, unless specified otherwise. Analyzing a particular algorithm falls under the field of algorithm analysis. To show an upper bound T(n) on the time complexity of a problem, one needs to show only that there is a particular algorithm with running time at most T(n). However, proving lower bounds is much more difficult, since lower bounds make a statement about all possible algorithms that solve a given problem. The phrase \"all possible algorithms\" includes not just the algorithms known today, but any algorithm that might be discovered in the future.

{"text": "Many of the same decisions and principles that apply in other criminal investigations and arrests arise also in civil disobedience cases. For example, the suspect may need to decide whether or not to grant a consent search of his property, and whether or not to talk to police officers. Many civil disobedients believe that it is best not to answer questions from criminal investigators, and have been known to refuse to grant consent searches and to refuse to talk to them. Despite this, some civil disobedients have nevertheless found it hard to resist responding to investigators' questions, sometimes due to a lack of understanding of the legal ramifications, or due to a fear of seeming rude. Also, some civil disobedients seek to use the arrest as an opportunity to make an impression on the officers.

He plays Tom Sharky, a vice detective who's on the trail of an international mobster (Vittorio Gassman) and the man he's financing to be the next governor of Georgia (Earl Holliman). In the novel by William Diehl, the story is more complex because the guy's running for president. This is a very long movie that feels more like three hours instead of two. The filming in downtown Atlanta and the Peachtree Plaza hotel sets the mood just right for the story. Reynolds doesn't do much laughing in this one compared to his comedy films. He's very serious here, especially in the beginning of the movie because he gets demoted for a dope bust that goes wrong. At times though, the movie plays more like a voyeuristic drama than a crime film with Burt trying to get close to the mobster's woman.

The simplest approach is to rapidly change non-essential epitopes on the surface of the pathogen. This can be done by changing the amino acids or sugar components that form part of the surface of the virus. An example of this is HIV, which mutates rapidly and thus the proteins that are essential for entry into the host target cell are constantly changing. The parasite Trypanosoma brucei also uses this strategy, constantly switching one type of surface protein for another to avoid detection by the immune system. Masking antigens with host molecules is another common strategy to evade detection by the immune system.

The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union is drafted from the human rights enshrined in the Convention, and directly applies to the European Union and its institutions. This creates a constitutional basis for the European Union and ensures that fundamental rights are protected from any actions by the EU. This is reflected in the detailed list of fundamental rights set out in the Charter, as well as the wider understanding that these rights need to be protected.", "label": "dolly"}

{"text": "The objective of this study was to investigate the clinical application of a pedicled forearm flap in the reconstruction of soft tissue defects after oral cancer resection. Methods included a retrospective analysis of 31 patients with oral cancer in the affiliated Stomatology Hospital of Kunming Medical University, who underwent repair of soft tissue defects resulting from oral cancer resection using a pedicled forearm flap. Patient's follow up for 3 months to 3 years was conducted to observe the survival rate of the pedicled forearm flap and the recovery of the patient's appearance and oral function. The results showed that the pedicled forearm flap survived in 30 patients (96.77%), and 3 patients showed flap vascular crisis (9.67%) which were successfully rescued. Articulation, chewing, and swallowing functions of the patients were improved after surgery. Based on these results, the pedicled forearm flap has advantages of color and texture, its moderate thickness, long vascular pedicle, good blood supply, and strong infection resistance. It is an excellent skin-muscle flap suited to the repair of soft tissue defects after oral cancer resection.", "label": "dolly"}

In this work, a new model independent procedure for two of the aforementioned steps (background suppression and peak fitting) is presented. Morphological mathematics is used for the former, while the latter relies on the Hankel Lanczos Singular Value Decomposition technique.

The current experimental data on the CP-averaged branching ratios and direct CP asymmetries are analyzed. It is found that, while the branching ratios and direct CP asymmetries do not constrain the parameter space much further compared to inclusive decays, complementary constraints can be obtained from isospin asymmetries and correlations between various observables in exclusive and inclusive decays. In addition, predictions are made for several observables yet to be measured.", "label": "dolly"}

Two types of single vortex states have been observed, which are usually referred to as the S-vortex and U-vortex.  We theoretically study the single vortex excitations in spherical and elongated condensates as a function of the interaction strength.  We solve numerically the Gross-Pitaevskii equation and calculate the angular momentum as a function of precession frequency.  The existence of two types of vortices means that we have two different precession frequencies for each angular momentum value.  As the interaction strength increases, the vortex lines bend and the precession frequencies shift to lower values.  We establish that for a given angular momentum the S-vortex has higher energy than the U-vortex in a rotating elongated condensate.  We show that the S-vortex is related to the solitonic vortex which is a nonlinear excitation in the non-rotating system.  For small interaction strengths the S-vortex is related to the dark soliton.

{"text": "We calculate the current - phase relation of a long Josephson junction consisting of two ferromagnetic domains with equal magnetization, but opposite direction. In the clean limit, the current - phase relation is obtained with the help of the Eilenberger equation. In general, the supercurrent oscillations are non-sinusoidal and their amplitude decays algebraically with increasing exchange field. If the two domains have the same size, the amplitude is independent of the exchange field, due to an exact cancellation of the phases acquired in each ferromagnetic domain. These results change drastically in the presence of disorder. We explicitly study two cases: domain size fluctuations in the framework of the Eilenberger equation and impurity scattering in the framework of the Usadel equation. In both cases, the current - phase relation becomes sinusoidal and the amplitude of the supercurrent oscillations is exponentially suppressed with the exchange field, even if the domains are identical on average.", "label": "dolly"}

In the cumulative region, the finite formation time effects which result from the real part of the ejectile propagator are taken into account. It is found that the relative weight of the rescattering steadily grows with the scaling variable becoming of the order of unity at certain values of the scaling variable. At such values of the scaling variable, the finite formation time effects become fairly visible, which may serve for their study at relatively small values of the four-momentum transfer.

{"text": "I enjoy ghost stories. Good ghost stories of unexplained bumps in the night, voices that cannot be explained. I've seen many of them. As special effects have grown more and more in films, sometimes it's necessary to go back to the time when writers and directors really had to use their heads to create good ghost stories. This is one, very rare, pilot episode of the TV series, \"Ghost Story\", which was one of the most frightening films I've ever seen. It was on once in 1972, when I was only nine, but nothing since then even compared to it. With all the remakes going on in Hollywood, someone should take it off and produce the \"as is\" series just like this, with no more special effects than the original. This episode was very creepy, just like hell. I'm lucky to find it on DVD today and very rare and hard to find. The only other 2 ghost stories that even come close are the original \"The Haunting\" and George C. Scott in \"The Changling\". I hope someone will make more ghost stories like these.", "label": "dolly"}

Many of the actors spoke like 9-year-olds pretending to be cynical and stone-hearted cops, or ultra-evil villains. The high-pitched voice-overs seemed amateurish. I would rather buy a cheap synthesizer to create better opening music. And the police torture scenes were totally unnecessary and had nothing to do with the actual events of the story. And Cox added a lot of things that seemed cool, but that really had nothing to do with the story. It's a big disappointment, because one of the things that makes Borges' stories so good is their minimalism, which made them tightly bound. This movie is the exact opposite.

EATL Type II is distinct from classic EATL and is unrelated to celiac disease. In contrast to Type I, Type II is not linked to celiac disease and occurs sporadically. Five cases of EATL Type II were diagnosed at our clinic from January 2009 to September 2012. Four of the five cases were diagnosed by endoscopy. Common endoscopic findings include innumerable fine granularities (also called \"mosaic mucosal patterns\") and diffuse thickening of the mucosa with a semicircular shallow ulceration in the lesions of the small bowel.

To address the issue of hidden social influence, we devise new algorithms to learn the model parameters of our proposal based on expectation maximization (EM). Furthermore, we develop a single-machine version of our EM algorithm and a parallelized implementation on the MapReduce framework to process two large-scale datasets we collect. Moreover, we show that the social influence obtained from our generative models can be used for group recommendation. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive experiments using the datasets crawled from last.fm and whrrl.com to validate our ideas. Experimental results show that the generative models with social influence significantly outperform those without incorporating social influence. The unified generative model proposed in this paper obtains the best performance.

{"text": "We consider the quantum mechanical propagator for a particle moving in a $1$-dimensional lorentz gas, with fixed hard sphere scatterers. To evaluate this propagator in the semi-classical region, and for times less than the ehrenfest time, we express its effect on an initial gaussian wave packet in terms of quantities analogous to those used to describe the exponential separation of classical trajectories in the classical version of this system. This result relates the spread of the wave packet to the rate of separation of classical trajectories, characterized by positive lyapunov exponents. We consider applications of these results, first to illustrate the behavior of the wave-packet auto-correlation functions for wave packets on periodic orbits. The auto-correlation function can be related to the fidelity, or loschmidt echo, for the special case that the perturbation is a small change in the mass of the particle. An exact expression for the fidelity, appropriate for this perturbation, leads to an analytical result valid over very long time intervals, inversely proportional to the size of the mass perturbation. For such perturbations, we then calculate the long-time echo for semi-classical wave packets on periodic orbits. This paper also corrects an earlier calculation for a quantum echo, included in a previous paper (nlin.cd/0307025). We explain the reasons for this correction.", "label": "dolly"}

This T.V. drama is so compelling that it should be made into a major motion picture. It's that good! I highly recommend this great drama to everyone who seeks to know the truth. It shows how British Intelligence (MI5 & MI6) attempt to expose a terrorist plot and conspiracy to destroy innocent victims - due to England's involvement in the Iraq War. The scenes of different parts of London, England are also spectacular. Dirty War is a must see!", "label": "dolly"}
{"text": "Gaussian mixture models ( GMMs ) are useful for density estimation and data clustering, however the model does not adapt well to curved and strongly nonlinear data. Recently there appeared an improvement called Acagmm (Active Curve Axis Gaussian Mixture Model) which fits gaussians along curves using an expectation-maximization (EM) approach. Using the ideas of Acagmm, I build an alternative active function model of clustering, which has some advantages over Acagmm. In particular, it is naturally defined in arbitrary dimensions and enables an easy adaptation to clustering of complicated datasets along the predefined family of functions. Furthermore, it does not need external methods to determine the number of clusters as it automatically reduces the number of groups on-line.

So far, these theorems have been obtained under the assumption that the work is determined by projective energy measurements at the end and the beginning of each run of the protocols. We found that one can replace these projective measurements only by special, protocol-dependent, error-free, generalized energy measurements with pairs of tailored post-measurement states that satisfy detailed balance-like relations. For other generalized measurements, the crooks relation is typically not satisfied. For the validity of the jarzynski equality, it is sufficient that the first energy measurements are error-free and the post-measurement states form a complete orthonormal set of elements in the Hilbert space of the considered system. Additionally, the effects of the second energy measurements must have unit trace. We illustrate our results by the example of a two-level system for different generalized measurements.", "label": "dolly"}

However, silly script writing ruined any promises the episode had. \n\nFirst of all, the woman readily admits to seeing things that would send most of us running in the other direction (e.g. \"It's funny that the door slammed shut even though there is no wind;\", \"This door has serious damage to it that wasn't here a minute ago;\", \"The door opened by itself, without me touching it;\", etc.). Given these supernatural phenomena, plus the fact that a woman committed suicide in the room, wouldn't she take some precaution before entering it? Maybe she could investigate in the day time. Or maybe she could investigate the apartment with somebody else. Or maybe she could TURN ON THE LIGHTS!!! Also, while in the haunted apartment, she decides to make numerous phone calls to the operator and gets into an argument over who has the power to disconnect the phone, and then they begin discussing the details of the suicide. JUST UNPLUG THE PHONE! The phone company doesn't need to be involved. Walk up to the phone and unplug it. Case closed.\n\nFinally, showing the phone scamper across the floor like it's alive was just comical.

{"text": "In this letter, we describe the pseudoparticle multipole method (PPM), a new method to express multipole expansion by a distribution of pseudoparticles. We can use this distribution of particles to calculate high order terms in both Barnes-Hut treecode and FMM. The primary advantage of PPM is that it works on Grape. Grape is a special-purpose hardware for the calculation of gravitational forces between particles. Although the treecode has been implemented on Grape, we can only handle terms up to dipole, since Grape can only calculate forces from point-mass particles. Thus, the calculation cost grows quickly when high accuracy is required. With PPM, the multipole expansion is expressed by particles, and so Grape can calculate high order terms. We implemented an arbitrary-order treecode on Grape-4. Timing results show Grape-4 accelerates the calculation by a factor between 10 ( for low accuracy) and 150 ( for high accuracy). Even on general-purpose programmable computers, our method offers the advantage that the mathematical formulae and therefore the actual program is much simpler than that of the direct implementation of multipole expansion.", "label": "dolly"}

{"text": "In the vicinity of their glass transition, dense colloidal suspensions acquire elastic properties over experimental timescales. We investigate the possibility of a viscoelastic instability in curved geometry for such materials. To this end, we first present a general strategy extending a first-principles approach based on projections onto slow variables (so far restricted to strictly homogeneous flow) to handle inhomogeneities. In particular, we separate the advection of the microstructure by the flow, at the origin of a fluctuation advection term, from the intrinsic dynamics. On account of the complexity of the involved equations, we then opt for a drastic simplification of the theory, in order to establish its potential to describe instabilities. These very strong approximations lead to a constitutive equation of the white - metzner class, whose parameters are fitted with experimental measurements of the macroscopic rheology of a glass-forming colloidal dispersion. The model properly accounts for the shear-thinning properties of the dispersions, but, owing to the approximations, the description is not fully quantitative. Finally, we perform a linear stability analysis of the flow in the experimentally relevant cylindrical (Taylor-Couette) geometry and provide evidence that shear-thinning strongly stabilizes the flow, which can explain why viscoelastic instabilities are not observed in dense colloidal suspensions.

We consider two hallmarks of cooperative effects, superradiance and subradiance, and compute for each the rate of energy radiated by the atoms and the coherence of the atomic state during the time evolution. We adopt a statistical approach in order to extract the typical behavior of the atomic dynamics and average over random atomic distributions in spherical containers with prescribed values of the radiation wavenumber and average interatomic distance. Our approach allows us to highlight the tradeoff between finite-size effects and dipole-dipole interactions in superradiance / subradiance. In particular, we show the existence of an optimal value of the radiation wavenumber for which the superradiant intensity and coherence pulses are the less affected by dephasing effects induced by dipole-dipole interactions and finite-size effects.", "label": "dolly"}
{"text": "The tropical form of endomyocardial fibrosis (EMF) is a very common medical problem in the coastal districts of south India, especially the Kerala state. Clinical and autopsy studies have shown left and right ventricular apical fibrosis, with varying degree of atrioventricular valve regurgitation. Left ventricular endomyocardial fibrosis presents with severe pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular endomyocardial fibrosis presents very high systemic venous pressure and congestive cardiac failure. Surgical management improved the natural history of the disease to some extent. Various infectious and toxic factors have been postulated regarding its aetiology. During the last few years, incidence of the disease has decreased considerably. The only explanation identified is the significant improvement in the living standards of the people with the corresponding decline in the childhood malnutrition, infections, worm infestation and associated eosinophilia.", "label": "dolly"}

We focused on analyzing the short bursts from the three sources and studied their temporal and spectral properties. We employed the Bayesian Block algorithm to detect and locate the short bursts. The duration distributions of short bursts were fitted with two lognormal functions. We found that the burst spectrum could be well described with two blackbody components or optically thin thermal bremsstrahlung model for AX J1622.1-4950 and AX J1845.0-0258, and that there is a positive correlation between burst luminosity and persistent luminosity for SGR J1550-5418.

At each time step, these rules are selected with probability and. For several irregular profiles that depend on, a family of equipotential lines is evaluated. The lines are characterized by the skewness and kurtosis of the height distribution. The results indicate that the skewness of the equipotential line increases when they approach the flat anode, and this increase has a non-trivial convergence to a delta distribution that characterizes the equipotential line in a uniform electric field.

We demonstrate this by explicitly computing the nonperturbative spectral action for some candidate flat cosmic topologies given by Bieberbach manifolds and showing that the resulting inflation potential differs from that of the flat torus by a multiplicative factor, similarly to what happens in the case of the spherical forms in relation to the case of the sphere. We then show that, while the slow-roll parameters differ between the spherical and flat manifolds, they do not distinguish different topologies within each class, while the power spectra detect the different scalings of the slow-roll potential and therefore distinguish between the various topologies, both in the spherical and in the flat case.", "label": "dolly"}

{"text": "The centrifugal governor was first adopted in 1788 by James Watt for use on a steam engine. It could not maintain a constant speed in response to changes in load, since it would assume a new constant speed when exposed to such changes. Instead, it was effective in handling smaller fluctuations such as those due to fluctuating heat load in the boiler. As a result, engines equipped with only the centrifugal governor were not suitable for operations that require a constant speed such as cotton spinning. Over time, the governor was improved and coupled with variable steam cut-off, it was possible to attain a good speed control in response to load changes. By the end of the 19th century, this was the state-of-the-art technology.", "label": "dolly"}

{"text": "A wireless powered communication network ( wpcn ) is a novel networking paradigm that uses radio frequency ( rf ) wireless energy transfer ( wet ) technology to power the information transmissions of wireless devices ( wds ). When energy and information are transferred in the same frequency band, a major design issue is transmission scheduling to avoid interference and achieve high communication performance. Commonly used centralized scheduling methods in wpcn may result in high control signaling overhead and thus are not suitable for wireless networks constituting a large number of wds with random locations and dynamic operations. To tackle this issue, we propose a distributed scheduling protocol for energy and information transmissions in wpcn. Specifically, we allow a wd that is about to deplete its battery to broadcast an energy request buzz ( erb ) which triggers wet from its associated hybrid access point ( hap ) to recharge the battery. If no erb is sent, the wds contend to transmit data to the hap using the conventional @xmath0-persistent csma ( carrier sensing multiple access ). In particular, we propose an energy queueing model based on an energy decoupling property to derive the throughput performance. Our analysis is verified through simulations under practical network parameters, which demonstrate good throughput performance of the distributed scheduling protocol and reveal some interesting design insights that are different from conventional contention-based communication networks assuming the wds are powered with unlimited energy supplies.", "label": "dolly"}

{"text": "Self-amplifying RNA or RNA replicon is a form of nucleic acid-based vaccine derived from either positive-strand or negative-strand RNA viruses. The gene sequences encoding structural proteins in these RNA viruses are replaced by MRNA encoding antigens of interest as well as by RNA polymerase for replication and transcription. This kind of vaccine has been successfully assessed with many different antigens as vaccines candidates, including mice, nonhuman primates and humans. A key challenge to realizing the broad potential of self-amplifying vaccines is the need for safe and effective delivery methods. Ideally, a rna nanocarrier should provide protection from blood nucleases and extended blood circulation, which ultimately would increase the possibility of reaching the target tissue. The delivery system must then be internalized by the target cell and, upon receptor-mediated endocytosis, must be able to escape from the endosomal compartment into the cell cytoplasm, where the rna machinery is located. Further, delivery systems for systemic administration ought to be well tolerated upon administration. They should be safe, enabling the multi-administration treatment modalities required for improved clinical outcomes and, from a developmental point of view, production of large batches with reproducible specifications is also desirable.

These solutions decrease the total mechanical energy and provide striking examples of non-uniqueness of entropy weak solutions (for polyconvex energies) due to point singularities at the cavity. To resolve this paradox, they introduce the concept of singular limiting induced from continuum solution, according to which a discontinuous motion is a slic-solution if its average forms a smooth family of approximate solutions to the problem. It turns out that there is an energetic cost for creating the cavity, which is captured by the notion of slic-solution but neglected by the usual entropic weak solutions. Once this cost is accounted for, the total mechanical energy of the cavitating solution is in fact larger than that of the homogeneously deformed state. They also apply the notion of slic-solutions to a one-dimensional example describing the onset of fracture and to gas dynamics in langrangean coordinates with riemann data inducing vacuum in the wave fan.

{"text": "A feasibility study will examine options for a five-mile network linking the city centre and Penarth, Vale of Glamorgan. The planned system will have gondolas travelling along a route from Cardiff Central Station, carrying up to 2,500 tourists and commuters per hour. CBC Chairman Nigel Roberts said that the great thing about Cardiff Bay is that, when travelling in the gondolas, passengers can get a beautiful view of the area. If plans are put into place, the gondolas will pass through the city's Central Square and Cardiff Bay before terminating in Penarth. The scheme could cost around £20m per mile, which may be funded by the Welsh Transport budget, the private sector, and sponsorship. Chancellor George Osborne's announcement of a City Deal was also seen to benefit the potential plans for the Cardiff Bay Cable Line. \"This would be a sustainable public transport system which would serve our growing city,\" Mr Roberts said, adding that he would like to be able to ride on the line himself.

{"text": "This paper studies the frequency/time-selective Gaussian interference channel with secrecy constraints. Two distinct models, namely the interference channel with confidential messages and the one with an external eavesdropper, are analyzed. The key difference between the two models is the lack of channel state information (CSI) about the external eavesdropper. Using interference alignment along with secrecy pre-coding, it is shown that each user can achieve non-zero secure degrees of freedom (dof) for both cases. Specifically, the proposed coding scheme achieves secure dof _ with probability one _ per user in the confidential messages model. For the external eavesdropper scenario, on the other hand, it is shown that each user can achieve secure dof _ in the ergodic setting. Remarkably, these results establish the positive impact of interference on the secrecy capacity region of wireless networks.", "label": "dolly"}

In order for laws in the EU to have legal effect, they should be formulated so that they are clearly understood by those subject to the law. In European Union law the principle of legal certainty prohibits ex post facto laws, i.e. laws should not come into force before they are published.

{"text": "Interferons (IFNs) were initially identified as antiviral molecules that exert pleiotropic physiological processes ranging from immune modulation, control of proliferation, apoptosis, to antitumor activity. However, type I IFNs (IFNs-I) have recently been shown to apply both beneficial and detrimental effects to the central nervous system (CNS) and a tightly balanced equilibrium between cellular activation and inhibition seems to be essential to maintain homeostasis within the CNS. In inflammatory pathologies affecting the CNS, IFNs-I are in the center of attention not only because interferon beta is used as a standard therapeutic in the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS), but also as IFN-I expression is associated with distinct pathologies. Despite the great efficiency of IFN-I in reducing MS relapses and attenuation of novel inflammatory lesions, underlying molecular mechanisms and cellular target specificities are just beginning to emerge. In contrast to the curative effects, aberrant activation of the IFN-I response have also been shown to be associated with detrimental effects exemplified by the Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome (AGS), a severe disabling autoimmune inflammatory encephalopathy.

The described surgical technique consisted of a minimal incision and simple fixation of the penile shaft skin and superficial fascia to the prepubic deep fascia, without degloving the penile skin. Result: The mean age of the patients was 10.2 years (ranging from 8 to 15 years). The median follow-up was 19 months (range, 5-49 months). The mean penile lengths were 1.8 cm (range, 1.1-2.5 cm) preoperatively and 4.5 cm (range, 3.3-5.8 cm) postoperatively.

The nickname may have been a combination of the Swiss politician Besançon Hugues (died 1532) and the religiously conflicted nature of Swiss republicanism in his time, using a clever derogatory pun on the name Hugues by way of the Dutch word Huisgenoten (literally housemates), referring to the connotations of a somewhat related word in German Eidgenosse (Confederates as in \"a citizen of one of the states of the Swiss Confederacy\"). Geneva was John Calvin's adopted home and the centre of the Calvinist movement. In Geneva, Hugues, though Catholic, was a leader of the \"Confederate Party\", so called because it favoured independence from the Duke of Savoy through an alliance between the city-state of Geneva and the Swiss Confederation. The label Huguenot was purportedly first applied in France to those conspirators (all of them aristocratic members of the Reformed Church) involved in the Amboise plot of 1560: a foiled attempt to wrest power in France from the influential House of Guise.

Furthermore, in the analysis of the data, it was observed that patients with cervical and endometrial cancer had lower bmd t - scores compared to controls even though some patients had achieved good responses to cancer treatment. This may be explained by an increased rate of bone turnover in the patients with endometrial cancer, suggesting that bone metabolism should be investigated further.

{"text": "We use a set of simulation-based models for the dissipationless evolution of galaxies since @xmath0 to constrain the fate of accreted satellites embedded in dark matter subhalos. These models assign stellar mass to dark matter halos at @xmath0 by relating the observed galaxy stellar mass function ( gsmf ) to the halo+subhalo mass function monotonically. The evolution of the stellar mass content is then followed using halo merger trees extracted from @xmath1-body simulations. Our models are differentiated only in the fate assigned to satellite galaxies once subhalos, within which satellites are embedded, disrupt. These models are confronted with the observed evolution in the massive end of the gsmf, the brightest cluster galaxy ( bcg)-cluster mass relation, and the combined bcg and intracluster light (icl) luminosity distribution. The combined observational constraints favor a model in which the vast majority (3% or more) of satellite stars from disrupted subhalos go into the icl (operationally defined here as light below a surface brightness cut of @xmath4 mag arcsec@xmath5). Conversely, models that leave behind a significant population of satellite galaxies once the subhalo has disrupted are strongly disfavored, as are models that put a significant fraction of satellite stars into the bcg. Our results show that observations of the icl provide useful and unique constraints on models of galaxy merging and the dissipationless evolution of galaxies in groups and clusters.", "label": "dolly"}

Moreover, a systematic search for putative formin homologs in the arabidopsis genome suggests that they may be cytoplasmic or nuclear proteins, and it is not known if they are involved in signaling with the plasma membrane. Despite the lack of known functions in plants, this study highlights the presence of significant structural features specific to plant formins.

{"text": "The relationship of Ctenophora to the rest of Metazoa is very important to our understanding of the early evolution of animals and the origin of multicellularity. It has been the focus of debate for many years. Ctenophores have been purported to be the sister lineage to the Bilateria, sister to the Cnidaria, sister to Cnidaria, Placozoa and Bilateria, and sister to all other animal phyla. A series of studies that looked at the presence and absence of members of gene families and signalling pathways (e.g., homeoboxes, nuclear receptors, the Wnt signaling pathway, and sodium channels) showed evidence congruent with the latter two scenarios, that Ctenophora are either sister to Cnidaria, Placozoa and Bilateria or sister to all other animal phyla. Several more recent studies comparing complete sequenced genomes of ctenophores with other sequenced animal genomes have also supported Ctenophora as the sister lineage to all other animals. This position would suggest that neural and muscle cell types were either lost in major animal lineages (e.g., Porifera) or that they evolved independently in the ctenophore lineage. However, other researchers have argued that the placement of Ctenophora as sister to all other animals is a statistical anomaly caused by the high rate of evolution in ctenophore genomes, and that Porifera (sponges) is the earliest-diverging animal phylum instead.

{"text": "We discuss the mechanism of cluster formation in hierarchically collapsing molecular clouds, which provide evidence both observationally and numerically, that molecular clouds may be undergoing global, hierarchical gravitational collapse. The \"hierarchical\" regime consists of small-scale collapses within larger-scale ones. The latter implies that the star formation rate increases systematically during the early stages of evolution, and is due to filamentary flows onto \"hubs\" of higher density, mass, and velocity dispersion, and culminates a few Myr after the small-scale collapses have started to form stars. In turn, the small-scale collapses occur in clumps embedded in the filaments, and are themselves falling into the larger potential well of the still-ongoing large-scale collapse. The stars formed in the early small-scale collapses share the infall motion of their parent clumps towards the larger potential trough, so that the filaments feed both gaseous and stellar material to the hubs. This leads to the presence of older stars in a region where new protostars are still forming, to a scale-free or fractal structure of the clusters, in which each unit is composed of smaller-scale ones, and to the eventual merging of the subunits explaining the observed structural features of open clusters.", "label": "dolly"}

{"text": "We used a dynamic hydrology model to simulate water table depth and quantify the relationship between Saint Louis encephalitis virus transmission and hydrologic conditions in Indian River County, Florida, from 1986 through 1991, a period with an SLEV epidemic. Virus transmission followed periods of modeled drought, specifically low water table depths 12 to 17 weeks before virus transmission, followed by a rising of the water table 1 to 2 weeks before virus transmission. Further evidence from collections of Culex nigripalpus, the major mosquito vector of SLEV in Florida, suggests that during extended spring droughts vector mosquitoes and juvenile, adult wild birds congregate in selected refuges, facilitating epizootic amplification of SLEV. When the drought ends and habitat availability increases, the SLEV-infected Culex nigripalpus and wild birds disperse, initiating an SLEV transmission cycle. These findings demonstrate a mechanism by which drought facilitates the amplification of SLEV and its subsequent transmission to humans.", "label": "dolly"}

{"text": "This article introduces a highly parallel algorithm for molecular dynamics simulations with short-range forces on single node, multi- and many-core systems. The algorithm is designed to achieve high parallel speedups for strongly inhomogeneous systems such as nanodevices or nanostructured materials. In the proposed scheme, the calculation of the forces and the generation of neighbor lists are divided into small tasks. These tasks are then executed by a thread pool according to a dependent task schedule. This schedule is constructed in such a way that a particle is never accessed by two threads at the same time. Benchmark simulations on a typical 12-core machine show that the described algorithm achieves excellent parallel efficiencies above 80% for different kinds of systems and all numbers of cores. For inhomogeneous systems the speedups are strongly superior to those obtained with spatial decomposition. Further benchmarks were performed on an Intel Xeon Phi coprocessor. These simulations demonstrate that the algorithm scales well to large numbers of cores.", "label": "dolly"}

We constructed the mass models based on the results of a profile decomposition into disk, bulge, and bar components.  Our models have three different nuclear structures according to the assumption about the nuclear bar: no nuclear bar, a synchronous nuclear bar and a fast nuclear bar.  Our SPH simulations show that the morphology of the nuclear region of NGC 4314, which is characterized by an elongated ring/spiral of newly formed stars and HII regions, aligned nearly parallel to the primary bar, can be understood in terms of the secular evolution driven by the non-axisymmetric potential.  The slightly elongated and aligned nuclear ring of NGC 4314 can be formed by the strong barred potential and the moderate central concentration of the bulge mass with and without a nuclear bar.  However, the nuclear spiral pattern can not be developed without a nuclear bar.  The nuclear bar of NGC 4314 seems to rotate faster than the primary bar since the nuclear morphology induced by the synchronous nuclear bar is much different from the observed one.", "label": "dolly"}

{"text": "Densely-packed bundles of biologically filamentous proteins are common and critical structural elements in a range of biological materials. While most bundles form from intrinsically straight proteins, there are notable examples of protein filaments possessing a natural curvature, such as the helical bacterial flagellum. We study the nonlinear interplay between thermodynamic preference for dense and regular inter filament packing and the mechanical preference for uniform filament shape in bundles of helically-curved proteins. Geometric constraints in bundles make perfect inter filament packing incompatible with perfect intra filament packing. As a consequence, we predict that bundle packing exhibits a strong sensitivity to bundle size, evolving from the isometric packing at small radii to an isomorphic packing at larger radii. The nature of the transition between these extremal states depends on the thermodynamic cost of packing distortion, with packing in elastically-constrained bundles evolving smoothly with size, while packing in osmotically-compressed bundles may exhibit a singular transition from the isometric packing at a finite bundle radius. We consider the equilibrium assembly of bundles in a saturated solution of filaments and show that mechanical cost of isomorphic packing leads to self-limited equilibrium bundle diameters whose size and range of thermodynamic stability depend both on condensation mechanism, as well as the helical geometry of filaments.", "label": "dolly"}

Sidwell made 19 appearances for Brighton on loan from Stoke before signing for the club in June 2016. In that time he has put in good performances and has given himself every opportunity to be offered a new contract. On BBC Radio Sussex, Sidwell said: \"When I signed the contract last year no-one expected me to play as many games as I have. I've probably given a better impact than expected. \"When I have played I've played well, I've put my best foot forward and I've given myself every opportunity to earn a new deal. \"If there's one on the table then hopefully we can thrash it out, it can be done and we can enjoy the summer.\"", "label": "dolly"}

However, there is no adequate data relating to gait symmetry parameters in the context of knee osteoarthritis.  This study evaluates a 3d - kinematic system using body-mounted sensors and spectral analysis for data post processing.  Twelve patients with unilateral knee osteoarthritis and seven age-matched controls were studied.  The results of both gait analysis systems are significantly correlated.  Five parameters are significantly different between the knee osteoarthritis and control groups.  To overcome time spent in expensive post-processing routines, spectral analysis of the recorded data is recommended.  Finally, the 3d - kinematic system is objective, inexpensive, accurate and portable, and allows long-term recordings in clinical, sport and ergonomic/functional capacity evaluation settings.", "label": "dolly"}

{"text": "Harvard's athletic rivalry with Yale is intense in every sport in which they meet, coming to a climax each fall in the annual football meeting, which dates back to 1875 and is usually called \"The Game\". While Harvard's football team is no longer one of the country's best as it often was a century ago during football's early days, both it and Yale have influenced the way the game is played. In 1903, Harvard Stadium introduced a new era into football with the first-ever permanent reinforced concrete stadium of its kind in the country. The stadium's structure actually played a role in the evolution of the college game. Seeking to reduce the alarming number of deaths and serious injuries in the sport, Walter Camp (former captain of the Yale football team) suggested widening the field to open up the game. But the stadium was too narrow to accommodate a wider playing surface. So, other steps had to be taken. Camp would instead support revolutionary new rules for the 1906 season. These included legalizing the forward pass, perhaps the most significant rule change in the sport's history.", "label": "dolly"}

{"text": "Antibody mediated therapeutic strategies against human malignant tumors have been widely authorized and clinically applied to cancer patients. In order to develop methods to generate antibodies reactive to the extracellular domains of multipass plasma membrane proteins specifically expressed in malignant tumors, we examined the use of dendritic cells (DCs) for immunization. DCs were transduced with genes encoding the human six transmembrane epithelial antigen of prostate 1 (STEAP1), STEAP4, and seven transmembrane prostate specific G-protein coupled receptor (PSGR). Mice were immunized with these DCs and followed by repeated booster immunization with plasmids expressing each protein. The immunized mice produced significant amounts of antibodies against these proteins. Our results suggest that DC immunization is an effective method to produce antibodies reactive to extracellular regions of plasma membrane proteins with multiple transmembrane domains, and may be useful to develop antibody mediated antitumor therapies.", "label": "dolly"}

For correlation matrices of multivariate gaussian variables, we analytically determine the expected values of the Kullback-Leibler distance of a sample correlation matrix from a reference model and show that these values are known even when the specific model is unknown. We propose to use the Kullback-Leibler distance to estimate the information extracted from a correlation matrix by correlation filtering procedures. We also show how to use this distance to measure the stability of filtering procedures with respect to statistical uncertainty. We explain the effectiveness of our method by comparing four filtering procedures, two of them being based on spectral analysis and the other two on hierarchical clustering. We compare these techniques as applied both to simulations of factor models and empirical data. We investigate the ability of these filtering procedures in recovering the correlation matrix of models from simulations. We discuss such an ability in terms of both the heterogeneity of model parameters and the length of data series. We also show that the two spectral techniques are typically more informative about the sample correlation matrix than techniques based on hierarchical clustering. We also demonstrate that the latter are more stable with respect to statistical uncertainty. Finally, we investigate the performance of the four filtering procedures applied to simulated and empirical data and we discuss the trade-off between a better fit to the data and a good model stability with respect to statistical uncertainty.", "label": "dolly"}

For example, IGFBP5 is one of these IGFBPs with special structural features, including a nuclear transport domain, heparin-binding motifs, and IGF/extracellular matrix/acid-labile subunit binding sites. Furthermore, IGFBP5 has several functional effects on carcinogenesis and normal cell processes, such as cell growth, death, motility, and tissue remodeling, and these biological effects are sometimes related with IGF (IGF-dependent effects) and sometimes not (IGF-independent effects). These functional roles of IGFBP5 are determined in a cell-type and tissue-type specific manner, but also depend on the diversity of interacting proteins and the potential for nuclear localization. Clinical findings have shown that IGFBP5 has the potential to be a useful clinical biomarker for predicting the response to therapies and clinical outcome of cancer patients.

{"text": "A theoretical description of the radial density profile of a finite number of identical charged particles confined in a harmonic trap is developed for application over a wide range of coulomb coupling (or equivalently, temperatures) and particle numbers.  A simple mean field approximation neglecting correlations yields a density profile which is monotonically decreasing with radius for all temperatures, in contrast to molecular dynamics simulations and experiments showing shell structure at lower temperatures.  A more complete theoretical description including charge correlations is developed here by an extension of the hypernetted chain approximation, developed for bulk fluids, to the confined charges.  The results reproduce all of the qualitative features observed in molecular dynamics simulations and experiments.  These predictions are then tested quantitatively by comparison with new benchmark Monte Carlo simulations.  Quantitative accuracy of the theory is obtained for the selected conditions by correcting the hypernetted chain approximation with a representation for the associated bridge functions.", "label": "dolly"}

{"text": "The Rankine cycle is sometimes referred to as a practical Carnot cycle because, when an efficient turbine is used, the TS diagram begins to resemble the Carnot cycle. The main difference is that heat addition (in the boiler) and rejection (in the condenser) are isobaric (constant pressure) processes in the Rankine cycle and isothermal (constant temperature) processes in the theoretical Carnot cycle. In this cycle a pump is used to pressurize the working fluid which is received from the condenser as a liquid not as a gas. Pumping the working fluid in liquid form during the cycle requires a small fraction of the energy to transport it compared to the energy needed to compress the working fluid in gaseous form in a compressor (as in the Carnot cycle). The cycle of a reciprocating steam engine differs from that of turbines because of condensation and re-evaporation occurring in the cylinder or in the steam inlet passages.", "label": "dolly"}

{"text": "Instead of using a separate entity to run the electricity system, the government has decided to create a legal entity within the National Grid organisation that is distinct from the other subsidiaries. The new system operator will have distinct employees, directors and offices, and will be completely separate from the existing electricity subsidiaries of National Grid. In the statement, the government welcomed the move, stating that National Grid was the best placed to deliver the system operator role given the changing energy landscape. National Grid owns and operates key parts of Britain's energy infrastructure. It charges generators regulated prices for the electricity it transports over its power network. But it also balances supply and demand across the network, something critics say it should be focused on doing as an independent system operator. Last year, MPs on the Energy Select Committee called for the introduction of an independent system operator, arguing that National Grid should be separated out and given this role to avoid potential conflicts of interest with its dual roles. The MPs expressed concern that despite efforts by National Grid and Ofgem to mitigate the potential for conflicts of interest, it still appears to be an \"intractable and growing\" problem. Critics have pointed to the situation in the US, where an independent system operator has operated successfully for several years. The government has also highlighted the disruption to the energy sector and the potential risks to security of supply that a break up could bring. In response, National Grid's CEO John Pettigrew has argued that creating a separate system operator is not the most effective way of addressing these issues. He says that the energy system is already well managed, and that the risks of disruption are more effectively managed by focusing on other parts of National Grid's responsibilities.
